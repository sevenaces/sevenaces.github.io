Born with Silver Spoon,Hungry for Gold
Corporate India's new generation of privileged citizens are more entrepreneurs, less managers. They are equally keen to innovate. Knowledge is their ultimate legacy.
By Kavil Ramachandran

ndian family businesses are undergoing a quiet transformation with the arrival of a number of young generation successors on the scene. They have started playing active roles in shaping the destiny of their family businesses while contributing to the rapid growth of the economy. The third decade of "freedom", after the process of liberalisation began in 1991, is witnessing a conscious and ambitious effort by family entrepreneurs to push the economy into higher orbits of growth in a big way. What we are witnessing now is the entry of another wave of youth entrepreneurship, many of them children of the earlier generation of entrepreneurs belonging to family businesses. The array of activities they are pursuing reinforces our faith in the potential of these leaders in the future of this country. They represent the capabilities, imaginations and aspirations of the younger generation of corporate India. Compared to earlier generations, these young men and women have grown up understanding the significance of knowledge, and naturally, education, with the exposure to best global practices and outlook, and professionalisation. They have been educated at reputed institutions in India and abroad. Most of them have worked in well-known organisations before joining the family business to pursue things that are to their liking and in synergy with the family's business interests. In essence, the post-qualified young generation has brought a breath of fresh air into many of these businesses. They are resultoriented and hungry for growth. These business families are in a unique and privileged position. Most of them have the benefit of a rich pool of resources that goes beyond material wealth. They have the experience of building and sustaining businesses in hostile environments. They have access to the right social network that comes handy in building new ventures or growing the existing ones. This is a resource pool that the country will look forward to as part of the next wave of transformation of the economy and society. We have the twin challenge of maintaining high levels of economic growth as well as providing social uplift. While GDP is registering an attractive rate of growth, the bulk of society is still crying for basic amenities. This is a paradox we will live with for many more years. The wide spectrum of potential customers belongs to every possible segment of income strata, offering unlimited opportunities

Karan Adani
24 Legacy Son of Gautam Adani, head of the Adani Group, the sixth largest corporate house in India Group Market Cap Rs 82,800 cr
"I can't forget my first day at Mundra port. It was peak summer. Straight from a university in the US, I was made to wear a boiler suit and a helmet and sent to the coal yard to understand basic operations. For hours, I kept moving with no drinking water. It was baptism by fire, literally." That was Adani Group head Gautam's son, Karan, in May 2009. Cut to 2012. He could still easily pass off as a schoolboy, but Karan Adani, 24, is now executive director of Adani Port and SEZ Ltd. Talk to him for 15 minutes and you realise the depth of knowledge the economics graduate from Purdue University brings to the table. Though the Adani Group has its finger in several pies--including power, coal, oil and gas exploration and real estate--Karan wants to build the group's future identity around port, power and logistics. "Ports are the gateway to investment in India. Port infrastructure is the benchmark of a country's growth across the world," says the young man who was not only closely involved with the developing of Mundra port but also Shell India's port at Hazira, Gujarat, which the Adani Group is developing. Karan was made to travel from Ahmedabad, where the Adanis are based, to Mundra in Kutch in AC II tier train compartments until his father recently allowed him to fly by jet. Karan now loves going out for a round of golf at the Gulmohur Greens Golf & Country Club on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. But the years of toil and sweat aren't lost on him. "No degree can substitute for hard experience. That's the greatest mantra I by Uday Mahurkar have learnt from my father."

Legacy Daughter of Ramanathan K. Nalli, founder of Nalli Silks Annual Revenue Rs 550 cr*
Her last name is synonymous with the silk sari business and Lavanya Nalli, a fifth-generation businessperson and only woman in the house of Nallis to work in the company, is making sure it stays that way. Lavanya spent her childhood wandering among Kancheepuram silks at the Nalli store below her grandfather's house in Chennai. It was no surprise when at 21, she took over as president of the Nalli group and infused new ideas in the 83-year-old chain, which has 23 outlets in 10 cities, as well as a store each in USA and Singapore. A premier sari retailer, it manufactures as well as exports fabric, apparel and home furnishing. Lavanya took time off in 2009 to pursue a degree at Harvard Business School and rejoined to launch Nalli Next, a boutique for working women. On a stint with McKinsey in Boston, US, it isn't just the whole six yards for this woman of substance. Lavanya dabbles in writing short stories, including a children's book series at Harvard. What's the silk scion's favourite sari? A Kanchi silk, by Lakshmi Kumaraswami obviously.

Legacy Son of Sanjay Lalbhai of the Arvind Lalbhai Group Group Market Cap Rs 2,050 cr
His ancestors used to lend money to Mughal emperors Akbar and Jehangir. His great grandfather Kasturbhai Lalbhai financed the Congress during the freedom struggle. Father Sanjay Lalbhai is managing director of Arvind Mills, one of the biggest denim manufacturers in the world. But Punit Lalbhai bears the burden of a rich legacy lightly on his shoulders. A postgraduate in environmental science from Yale University, he initially wanted to become a teacher. But a change of heart wasn't too long in coming. "I realised I'd be able to serve society better if I joined my father's business," he says. His helpful nature has spurred Arvind Mills to encourage farmers to grow organic cotton in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Over 70,000 acres have been brought under organic cotton cultivation as a result. The initiative has seen farmers' profits go up by 30-40 per cent. Based in Ahmedabad, Punit looks after four divisions of the Arvind Lalbhai Group: Technical textiles, water treatment, agro businesses and engineering. When he gets the time, he watches movies, The Godfather, starring Marlon Brando, being a favourite. Punit's dream is to build in a way that makes a difference to both the business and society. Such altruism isn't surprising given his family's illustrious history. by Uday Mahurkar

Legacy Daughter of Yes Bank

You'd think she was born to be a banker. But Raakhe Kapoor, daughter of Rana Kapoor, founder, MD and CEO of Yes Bank, has carved her own path. "Yes Bank is his (Rana's) baby. I am proud to be called his daughter but I have set my own path. I wish my friends to know me as an ambitious independent businesswoman, not just as a famous daughter." Armed with an MBA from Wharton Business School in the US, Raakhe has used Yes Bank as a training ground for future diversification. She joined as business manager in her father's Mumbai office in 2010 but her dream is to set up her own company in the next 12-18 months. "I will focus on the rising knowledge sector," she says. A science student, Raakhe developed an interest in economics after passing out from Mumbai's Cathedral and John Connon School. She would tag along with her father to meetings with business tycoons such as Anil Ambani and Adi Godrej. At home, she likes to discuss travel--Italy and Maldives being her favourite travel destinations-- current affairs and Indian food. Her wiry frame belies the sheer ambition within. "I aspire to be richer than my father in the next 10 years," she says without batting an eyelid. An avid piano player, Raakhe sure knows how to hit the right notes.

Legacy Heirs to the Piramal Healthcare Group Group Market Cap Rs 7,600 cr
The two Mumbai-based heirs of Piramal Group, whose interests span from healthcare and diagnostics to glass manufacturing and real estate, share a common concern for the underprivileged. If Group chairman Ajay Piramal's daughter, Nandini, has immersed herself in finding viable mass-market solutions to India's drinking water crisis since 2008, her younger brother Anand launched Dia, an NGO to serve the poor, in Rajasthan in 2004, when he was all of 19. Nandini, a graduate from Stanford Graduate School of Business, runs Piramal Water along with her husband Peter D'Young. Today, her Sarvajal project, that seeks to provide affordable and accessible pure water to all, has 140 franchises in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and parts of Maharashtra. Ask her why she is involved in the project and she will throw figures of waterborne illness as efficiently as she can count the profit of her business. She has been associated with the Piramal Group's strategic planning since 2006. In April 2009, she joined the group's board as executive director. Anand, an MBA from Harvard Business School, is currently executive director of the group's real estate business, Piramal Realty. Before he took off for Harvard in 2008, he was involved with the family's healthcare business, helping found Piramal e-Swasthya for Piramal Healthcare, a rural healthcare start-up that aspires to "democratise healthcare" using technology and sustainable business models. The models became a case study at Harvard Business School.

Aditya Burman 32
Legacy Son of Dabur Group Chairman Anand Burman Group Market Cap Rs 18,000 cr
His father, Anand C. Burman, is one of the country's top industrialists but that didn't stop Aditya Burman from working his way up from the bottom of the ladder. Graduating from the University of Kansas in 2004, he immediately joined Onquest Laboratories, a cancer diagnostics laboratory started by Anand, as an intern. Managing director of the Delhi-based lab since 2008, Aditya now wants to carve a niche for himself in the growing field of biotechnology, clinical and scientific testing. Aditya's credo is that no idea is a bad idea."I always encourage my team to think out of the box. Ideas often seem unfeasible but a solution can always be worked out," he says. Heading a network of labs often means long hours at work. Doesn't that impede his social life? Aditya says the time he gets with wife Shivani, a trained classical Hindustani singer, in the morning--as he downs his cup of coffee--and after returning from work is enough to unwind. "I am a huge fan of the TV show The Big Bang Theory, apart from being an ardent music lover."

This corporate heiress brings a global outlook, strategic vision and dedicated passion for social enterprise and institutionbuilding to her varied roles. At Delhi-based HCL Corporation and the Shiv Nadar Foundation, which was set up by her father, she is responsible for strategic decisions regarding the overall direction of the corporation. The vision for the HCL brand and the Shiv Nadar Foundation, of which she is one of the trustees, are guided by her. Initially, Roshni wanted to pursue a career in media."As an undergrad, I majored in radio, television and film. My first job was at Sky News in London. While I was working there, my dad and I had a serious chat about my future career. He was keen that I go to business school and made the point that I could never be a Rupert Murdoch unless I learnt how to manage a business. That clinched it," she says. She then did an MBA from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management. While at B-school, she discovered social enterprise management and chose that area as her field of expertise. "Our family foundation was already active in the field of education, and I felt I could use those skills best there," she says. She is not involved in an operational role and focuses more on the philanthropic aspect through the foundation. She is the driving force behind the VidyaGyan schools in Uttar Pradesh, aimed at inducting and transforming meritorious children from economically challenged backgrounds. She is also involved in a joint initiative with the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation in Delhi to promote the education of the Dalit and Muslim girl child in some of the most backward districts in Uttar Pradesh.

Eastern Promises
Shashwat Goenka
22 Legacy Son of Sanjiv Goenka, chairman of RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group Group Turnover Rs 14,000 cr
When Sanjiv Goenka went for a parentteacher meet at Kolkata's St Xavier's School for his son Shashwat, he was in for a shock. "Shashwat is creating a problem for other students," said his class teacher. The flummoxed chairman of the RPSanjiv Goenka Group--whose interests span from power, coal mining to retail and entertainment--asked why. "He never lets anyone else score the highest marks," chuckled the teacher. When Shashwat returns to India in May 2012 after completing his graduation in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he will embark on a journey that will see him eventually head the Rs 14,000-crore group, the star of Bengal's industrial firmament for the past nine decades. Insiders insist that under Shashwat, the group will be in safe hands. The plan is to ease him into leadership. He started off in 2010 at leading financial solutions company KPMG India as a corporate finance intern and then at nutrition giant Nestle India in the summer of 2011. "Shashwat has a curious mind and can quickly pick up issues. And immense humility," says Rajesh Jain, head of markets, KPMG. While at Wharton, he is already involved in the group's business, getting regular updates and reverting with his views on things. Shashwat is likely to steer clear of power distribution and generation company CESC Limited, the group's flagship company, and start with retail chain Spencer's, one of the most popular brands that the Goenkas own. "Retail excites me more than anything else," he explains. Shashwat grew up under the tutelage of father Sanjiv and grandfather Rama Prasad, the patriarch among Bengal industrialists. "He's a man in a hurry," says his father. "I was surprised to see that he had made provision for a week's sickness in the run-up to the preparation for his board exams," says Sanjiv, reflecting on the meticulous planner that Shashwat is. The family was always confident of his cultural moorings. "I have been mentored by my father and am inspired by my grandfather. I am very proud of my lineage," says the scion.

Aditi interned with leading financial management firm Merrill Lynch from 2005-2007 and then graduated from the Harvard Business School before joining DSP BlackRock "to implement what I learnt at Harvard".

The recent hit, The Descendants, starring George Clooney, is a current favourite, reminding her of how her father stood strong during her mother's ailment and took care of his children after her death. "I am inspired by my father. But I do not want to be like him," she says. Her idols? Laurence Fink, CEO of BlackRock, and Steve Jobs. Wildlife and experiencing different cultures invigorates her.

As a 10-year-old, Harsh harboured dreams of becoming an astronaut, and even now, plans to go on a commercial flight into space. But somewhere, deep down, he knew he would end up taking care of the family businesses of the Ashok Piramal Group that has interests in textiles, real estate, engineering and entertainment. After an MBA from London Business School, he worked within the group for Crossroads, India's first mall in Mumbai which came up in September 1999. He then worked for three years at the pharma businesses in Piramal Healthcare before settling down with Morarjee Textiles and PMP Auto Components. Rajeev also started out at Crossroads and later took over Peninsula Land, the group's real estate business. The youngest of the three brothers, Nandan, dabbled in law, interned at legal firm AZB Partners and UTV Software Communications before joining the family business. He is now in charge of two of the group's new ventures--Jammin, a family entertainment centre at Crossroads, and Pune Football Club. Work aside, Rajeev loves losing himself in his music, his Kindle and long drives. The Mumbai-based brothers are all travel enthusiasts-- London, Hong Kong, Cuba, Patagonia and Chile figuring on their list of `been there, done that'. But it is sports, especially football, that binds the trio. Chances are that if any of the brothers is out attending a sporting event, there would be two other Piramals for company.

Amruda and Aishwarya owe their passion for hospitality to their grandfather, C.P. Krishnan Nair. At 64, he founded the Leela hospitality group in 1986, naming it after his wife. The group now owns seven luxury hotels in India. The Mumbai-based sisters complement each other. Elder sister Amruda, who is head of corporate asset management, is the serious one, while Aishwarya, head of corporate foods and beverages, is cheerful and outgoing. Aishwarya, who has done a specialised course in culinary arts from the Culinary Institute of America in New York, loves to cook. She launched a bakery brand Dolce, and donates part of the earnings to prevent cruelty against animals. Amruda has a postgraduate degree in hospitality management from New York's Cornell University. Writing is a passion she tries to take time out for. In 2009, the sisters joined the family business. "It was the year after 26/11 happened. Media reports said there were threats to The Leela," says Amruda. "Our father was not really keen to have us join so soon, as we hadn't gained enough experience. But we did not have a choice,"says Amruda. "In the end, the hands-on experience helped us understand the industry better."

Ashni Biyani 27, Vivek Biyani 26 Legacy Heirs to the Future Group empire Group Market Cap Rs 5,900 cr
When Ashni Biyani was nine years old, she attended strategy sessions of Future Group, the retail giant, with her father Kishore Biyani, `KB' as she likes to call him. "Though initially I did not understand much, I picked up gradually," she says. Involvement in company affairs led her to come on board professionally. "I grew up with business all around me," says Ashni. Vivek, her cousin, spent his holidays attending business meetings with father Vijay Biyani and uncle Kishore. Ashni got inducted into the business in 2007 and Vivek in 2008, at a time when consumer spending was at its peak. But they hit their first crisis months later when recession struck the Indian economy. "I understood that one can't have the same strategy for growth and recession," says Mumbai-based Ashni. The young Biyanis have their roles fleshed out. Ashni looks after Holii, an accessory brand that she launched; it perhaps helps that she paints as a hobby. Vivek joined as director of Home Solutions Retail, the group's fastest growing segment. He also looks after E-zone, the electronics segment of the company. "My aim is to tap demand opportunities and create consumption," he says.

Rs 2,300 cr
Her June 5, 2011, wedding with Rohan Murthy, son of Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy, was talked about as the corporate tie-up of 2011. While Rohan is pursuing his doctorate at Harvard University, wife Lakshmi Venu is already in the thick of things at father Venu Srinivasan's TVS Motors. Lakshmi's rise has been meteoric. She joined as a management trainee in 2003 after finishing her doctorate in engineering management from University of Warwick, UK. In six years, she became director on the board of Sundaram Clayton, an auto components manufacturing company and TVS Motors' holding company. Now, as vice-president, global business development and strategy, Lakshmi is responsible for developing strategies and administering operations in the US. She is one of only three women managers in India's automobile industry. But therein lies the secret. While Sulajja Firodia Motwani of Kinetic Motors is the second, the third is Lakshmi's mother Mallika Srinivasan, who is chairman of tractor company TAFE. It's all in the genes. by Lakshmi Kumaraswami

other hand, is the first member of the third Godrej generation who is running an entire business on his own. A post-graduate in international relations from Columbia University, Pirojsha's thinking has its roots in his father's values of commitment and integrity. "Think big and be focused" , was his father's advice to him. He still swears by it. The Mumbai-based brother-sister duo are sports fanatics. Nisa is into trekking and water sports while Pirojsha often gets into his flannels for a game of cricket or plays chess when he wants to take it easy at home.

A legacy that dates back to 114 years is quite a burden for a young set of shoulders to carry. But for Nisaba and Pirojsha Godrej, it was an opportunity to prove themselves and uphold the values of an empire built by their forefathers. After working in the group as management trainees, Nisaba was made president, human capital and innovation, for Godrej Industries and associate companies in 2010 while Pirojsha recently worked his way up to become executive director, Godrej Properties. Nisa, as Nisaba is fondly referred to, has been given the job of driving the group's transformation, roping in fresh talent in order to give the company an innovative feel. Education of the girl child is one of her pet passions. The cause warrior that she is, she took it upon herself to spearhead the company's corporate social responsibility initiatives. Pirojsha, on the

Aditya Mittal's claim to fame is in having led Mittal Steel's successful bid for steel giant Arcelor in 2006 to create the first 100 million tonne-plus steel company. As chief financial officer, he was also instrumental in cutting the company's debt to 30 per cent following the mega merger. "It was the biggest IPO (initial public offering) in the steel industry. I learnt a lot in the run-up to it," he said. The economics graduate from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania is now steering the company away from his father's knack for snapping up failing steel plants on the cheap to big-ticket acquisitions. Aditya has established himself as a master dealmaker, spear-

heading the company's expansion into Central Europe, Africa and the US. Like the entire Mittal clan, Aditya is fiercely private about his passions but is known for his love of sports, playing squash and also running the London Marathon. He recently backed his wife, Megha, in her bid to acquire the bankrupt German luxury fashion brand Escada. The couple make for a famously workaholic duo but do find time for ski getaways to exotic slopes. However, they describe their perfect evening as one spent at home with their two daughters in London's upmarket Belgravia area or their Surrey country home.

The Suri children never had doubts about the course their future would take. "We were all made comfortable with the idea of joining the business from an early age," says Keshav, the youngest of the four Delhi-based Suri children, three of whom are executive directors of the Lalit hospitality group, which has nine hotels and has gone on an expansion spree in budget hotels. Deeksha did an MBA from the London School of Economics and Divya completed her LLB from King's College, London. While Deeksha's interest lies in HR development and recruitment, Divya, the eldest, looks after legal affairs. Keshav, who has a master's degree in international management from King's College, has brought new flavour through Kitty Su, The Lalit's watering hole in Delhi. The Suris want to launch 10 hotels by 2012, including one each in Dubai and Ko Samui. "I'm lucky to have a job that lets me be creative all the time," says Keshav.

Vir S. Advani 35
Legacy Grandson of Mohan Advani, founder of Blue Star Group Market Cap Rs 1,650 cr
For Vir Advani, being the heir apparent of airconditioning and refrigeration products major Blue Star is no guarantee of his accession to the top. The strategy is clear: He will have to work his way up, like his father Suneel Advani and uncle Ashok Advani. For now, Blue Star prefers calling him part of the next generation of promoters rather than an inheritor. He's also intent on earning his spurs, says B. Thiagarajan, president of the Blue Star group."He works from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily and gives a lot of personal attention to customers and staff," says Thiagarajan. Vir joined Blue Star Infotech, a solutions provider for travel and health services industries in Delhi, in 2000 after working for two years in New York. In 2007, he moved to Blue Star as vice-president of corporate affairs. In July 2011, he took over the business operations of the electro-mechanical projects group as president and executive director. As Blue Star attempts to reposition itself as a company with young blood, Vir represents the fresh face of the company. People in the organisation say he has boundless energy and is always open to ideas. by Shravya Jain

Piya 29, Veer 28, Tara 25 Legacy Children of Analjit Singh, founder of Max Group Group Market Cap Rs 4,200 cr
Having grown up watching her father Analjit Singh build the Max empire, Tara always wanted to be a part of the business. Founded in 1985, Max now has interests in healthcare, insurance, clinical research and packaging. "I always wanted to be involved in something that has been such an intrinsic part of our lives," says Tara, the chief executive of Senior Living that is part of the family's private firm Max Ventures. She has done an undergraduate course in Politics and South Asian Studies from the National University of Singapore. Her game plan is to nurture and develop the new business and get more exposure to the other sections of Max India. All three Delhi-based children are being groomed to lead the group in a way that suits their individual interests. Piya, who is more inclined towards serving people, works with Max Healthcare. Veer, on the other hand, is involved in the hospitality business. A science graduate from Imperial College London, his entry was incidental. "I committed myself to a project that I found very interesting and it eventually evolved into a new line of business. I just went with the flow and found myself where I am today," he explains. Veer feels that the legacy is something they have to live up to. "I never thought of the group as an inheritance," he says. Tara echoes his sentiments. "The challenge is to first make him (Analjit) proud," she says. Analjit is a mentor for all three of them, guiding them at every step. But Tara is not afraid of being compared to him. "We do not have a desire to be as good as him, but we have a desire to be known to as hard-working, good human beings," she says.
