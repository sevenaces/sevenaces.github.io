n October 28, the morning of the Cabinet reshuffle, when Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi walked into Ashoka Hall at Rashtrapati Bhavan, he did not enter from the main entrance used by other MPs and ministers. He walked in behind Congress chief Sonia Gandhi from the door reserved for VIPS such as President Pranab Mukherjee and Vice President Hamid Ansari. It was the first time Rahul was using this particular entrance and he was sending out a message: That he is now officially in the `big league'. But the symbolism was not accompanied by substance. The enlarged Cabinet was neither a celebration, nor a youthful revival for administrative urgency. Sometime next fortnight, Rahul will be anointed No. 2 in the party. Ten days before the

CONGRESS'S NUMBER GAME

CABINETRESHUFFLE
Quips a Karnataka minister, "First they ignore us, then they take away Vidya Balan from Jairam Ramesh," (Jairam has lost the sanitation portfolio of which Vidya is the brand ambassador). The east has been neglected. West Bengal has only three Congress ministers of state to replace the exit of the seven Trinamool Congress (TMC) ministers from the Government. After Pranab Mukherjee's exit, there isn't a single minister of Cabinet rank from here. Neither have Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa or Chhattisgarh get any Cabinet berths. Madhya Pradesh, where the Congress hopes to make a comeback, has only one Cabinet minister, albeit with two Cabinet berths (Kamal Nath). Even Rahul loyalist and Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh was forced to complain about the neglect of Madhya Pradesh. ronment" for business. "We should have lesser and easier laws, with heavy penalties. We should not make doing business in India complicated," he says. The new power minister, 40-year-old Jyotiraditya Scindia, talks about powering rural India. Even the usually docile Bansal has discovered he can bite, and is talking about hiking rail fares. Have Manmohan and Sonia waited too long to make these changes? General Elections are a little over a year away. After TMC'S pullout, the Government is dependent on the unreliable SP and BSP for support. This does not give the new team much room to push through crucial decisions, such as the much-needed pension and insurance reforms, and the land acquisition bill. Ideally, Rahul's Brigade should have been promoted to ministers of state with independent charge at least a year ago. That would have given them some room to perform. Currently, the Government is teetering from issue to issue. Recently, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram was asked whether he was sure he would present

reshuffle, he had dropped in to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at his Race Course Road residence in Delhi. Sonia was not present during this meeting. But the 22 new faces are hardly part of the Rahul Brigade; his imprint is visible only in the allocation of certain portfolios (see box). Manmohan's last reshuffle before the General Elections is more of a balancing act. It reflects the Prime Minister's reform agenda, Sonia's political expediency, Rahul's social priorities. There is no message, however, of positive governance. The elevation of both Salman Khurshid and Kamal Nath is necessitated by political context. Khurshid has been targeted by Arvind Kejriwal. By promoting him, the UPA Government is clearly thumbing its nose at the anti-corruption movement. Wary of a stormy Parliament session ahead, the combative Nath replaces the mild-mannered Pawan Bansal at the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. "Democracy is not a buffet table where you pick only what you want. Democracy comes with

all ingredients," says Nath, when asked how he would deal with an unruly Opposition and a critical civil society. The Prime Minister said his reshuffle had three elements: Youth, experience and relevance of portfolios. He forgot to add another: Political desperation. This has ensured that certain states get undue favour over others. As many as five ministers were sworn in from Andhra Pradesh; a sixth was upgraded to Cabinet status. This takes the state's tally to 11--obviously a reaction to the threat from Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. But some Congress MPs feel it is a wasted effort, for the party has little chance of retaining the state, as much because of Jagan as its own indecisiveness over Telangana. A visibly eager P. Balram Naik was so excited to be made Union minister that after the swearing in, he forgot to sign the register as he dashed to thank Sonia. Sometimes there is no rationale behind promoting a particular state. Take the pampered state of Kerala, which has as many as seven ministers. Compare this to the election-bound state of Karnataka which has only four.

the Budget next February. He replied, "I assure you there will be a Budget. It will be presented in Parliament. But whether there will be anyone to debate it, I don't know." The reshuffle has not affected the deadwood. Cabinet ministers Sushilkumar Shinde and A.K. Antony, neither of whom is known for his ministerial prowess, retain charge of two crucial portfolios--home and defence. The Minister for Steel, Beni Prasad Verma, was not dropped, even though his idea of governance is to get steel PSUS to host lunches for the media. Another minister in-charge of a crucial infrastructure portfolio, that of coal, Sriprakash Jaiswal, retains his ministry, despite allegations against him in the coal blocks allocation scam. Interestingly, even he was not certain he would retain the portfolio, for, at the swearing in ceremony, he was heard enquiring anxiously if the new list was out. Before the winter session begins end-November, Congress is planning

to hold a mammoth rally in the Capital. Various ministers have been asked to speak from the dais and showcase their achievements. FDI in multi-brand retail will be a major talking point. The Cabinet reshuffle is only the first step of the Congress makeover. Rahul's elevation is going to be the next. According to a senior Congress leader, "All the general secretaries will directly report to Rahul and he will report to the Congress president." Members of the Rahul Brigade, who have been left out of the reshuffle, will be given organisational responsibility. Veterans like Ambika Soni and Digvijaya are also tipped to play a key role in Team Rahul. None of them is likely to deliver the one thing the Congress needs most: UPA'S stability. Its largest ally, DMK, boycotted the recent reshuffle and refused to nominate ministers for its three vacancies. Nath has to do more than manage the Opposition--he will need to placate the allies. The best intentions of Manmohan could be defeated by political exigencies of allies, over whom he has no control.
