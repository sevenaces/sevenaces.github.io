AT A SCREEN NEAR YOU
Suspense films and gangster sagas. Will they set the box office on fire or prove duds?

The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher Nolan
Nolan reunites with Christian Bale for the last in the trilogy. Catwoman tells Wayne to batten down the hatches, "a storm is coming". She could be speaking for the world as it will be in 2012.

Talaash, Reema Kagti
Aamir Khan plays a police officer working in Mumbai's red light district. Grit and gore, but only after a marketing blitz.

Shanghai, Dibakar Banerjee
It's about the nexus of politics and business in a small town. Adapted from Greek writer Vassilis Vassilikos's novel, Z, which was made into a movie by Costa Gavras.

Gangs of Wasseypur, Anurag Kashyap
Two-part journey into the heart of Bihar's coal mining darkness. It's supposed to be epic and iconic.

Agent Vinod, Sriram Raghavan
What's the bet that Saif Ali Khan's magnum James Bond-ian opus will be released before he weds co-star Kareena Kapoor? The brilliant but selective Sriram Raghavan's reputation is on the line.

Prometheus, Ridley Scott
Michael Fassbender as android is enough reason to watch this. Noomi Rapace and Charlize Theron are icing on the ET cake.

Ek Tha Tiger, Kabir Khan
Together, ISI agent Katrina Kaif and RAW spy Salman Khan save the world from nuclear disaster. We hope it's less ludicrous than it sounds. But can't wait to see them duel and dance around each other in exotic destinations.

Maatran, K.V. Anand
Suriya plays conjoined twins. We can see Bollywood heroes queueing up for remake rights.

Agneepath, Karan Malhotra
An edgy remake of the Amitabh Bachchan classic, it may just be the one that makes romantic hero Hrithik Roshan join the ranks of unsmiling action stars. Sanjay Dutt plays the villain Kanchan Cheena.

Barfee, Anurag Basu
Ranbir Kapoor cannot hear or speak. Priyanka Chopra is mentally challenged. Expect another powerhouse performance from the Kapoor kid.
