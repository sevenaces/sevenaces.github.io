I think Khan Market is a good hub to shop in Delhi but recently Meherchand market has come up with some exciting new options. What I love about Meherchand is that the place has recently been discovered so it's not crowded, plus it has ample space which makes parking a lot easier than any other place in Delhi. Moreover, the place has everything one requires when they go shopping, from home products to simple décor items, furnishings, variety of options to buy clothes, restaurants and much more.

I love Gulabsingh Johrimal perfumery set in a dusty lane of Dariba Kalan in Chandni Chowk, which has been overseen by seven generations of the family. Then, a must-do in Pahar Gunj is to visit this tiny corner shop on the main square of the market which sells canvas printed bags. This shop sells the coolest canvas bags at the coolest prices. A Che Guevara printed canvas bag for just Rs 25! Strangely the shop does not have a name and the assistant sitting in the shop hasn't a clue why!
