LALU'S SPECIAL DISAPPEARANCE

R

JD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav is in

a dilemma. He has been asked by Jaya Prada, the actor-MP from Rampur, to do a guest appearance in a Bhojpuri film in which she has the lead role. But Lalu seems to be undecided about appearing in a movie at a time he's struggling to resurrect his party in Bihar. The movie may also have an item number by Rakhi Sawant. The film will be Jaya Prada's comeback as she has realised her political career is on the wane after she supported Amar Singh's revolt against Mulayam Singh Yadav. But will the other Yadav oblige her? Last heard, Lalu was not too keen to share a credit rating with the Rampur MP.

WALKING HIS TALK
t least three Congress Cabinet ministers objected to FDI in retail. They were A.K.Antony,Vayalar Ravi and Kamal Nath.While the first two were understandable because they represent the Left-leaning state of Kerala, the third took everyone by surprise as it did not fit Nath's corporatefriendly, Davos credentials. However, Nath was not objecting to the clearance to FDI in retail. His objection was that the Government was imposing too many conditions on the states. Instead, he argued that the states should be given a free hand to frame their own guidelines. Now that sounds like the Kamal Nath we know!

GADKARI

THE POWER TEE OFF
hile returning from his Canadian holiday last week, BJP chief Nitin Gadkari had a few hours' stopover in London. When the city's powerful NRI lobby heard of this, they invited him for tea. They were concerned about India's economic crisis. Gadkari assured them that BJP has already chalked out how to raise the GDP growth to 12 per cent when it comes to power."I won't tell you who all were there but they were all worried," was all Gadkari told INDIA TODAY when asked about the meet.

MODI'S NOT-SO-SMOOTH RIDE
arendra Modi's rath yatra ran into a very telling road-block recently. The rath got stuck in a potholed road in Saurashtra. Modi had to abandon it and proceed by an official car as it needed a crane to pull the hi-tech rath out. Ironic because the entire message of the yatra was to MODI DURING HIS RATH YATRA showcase Modi's track record on development, particularly good roads. And the name of his rath yatra? Swami Vivekanand Yuva Vichar Vikas Rath Yatra (Youth and Development Chariot). Oh dear.

The latest addition to Rahul Gandhi's library is Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think. It offers such gems as the best way to predict the future is to create it yourself. Is that motivation enough for Rahul?

TOO MANY UNCLES
an Akhilesh Yadav afford to embrace yet another chacha (uncle)? Last week, Congress leader Beni Prasad Verma gave the Samajwadi Party (SP) government 100 per cent marks for its performance during the last six months. Even Mulayam Singh Yadav is yet to give such a glowing endorsement to his son, while wife Dimple recently gave Akhilesh only 8/10. Now both the Congress and SP are wondering whether Akhilesh's Beni chacha is planning to change parties yet again.

THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEET ON SEPTEMBER 15

AZAD LEFT SPEECH-LESS
nion Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad is sulking. At the Planning Commission meet on September 15, Azad disapproved of Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia's proposed PPP model to implement universal health coverage. Instead, he wanted the public sector to handle it alone. But what really upset Azad was that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh interrupted his nearly 30-minute-long speech at the meet, asking him to hurry up as other ministers had to speak after him. Since Azad can trace his lineage back to Indira Gandhi's Cabinet, he was not amused at being reprimanded like a junior minister. Maybe the Cabinet reshuffle will bring some cheer to this once powerful Congress leader.

OUTREACH

NUCLEAR POLITICS

KHAN

P

akistan's current political crisis has given a new lease of life to A.Q. Khan, the Pakistani nuclear proliferator. Freed from house arrest by the courts in 2009, Khan has launched his own party called Tehreek-e-Tahafuz (Movement for Protection of Pakistan) in July. He is now promoting it on social networks. Khan's Twitter handle clearly states: `Founder of the Islamic bomb'. But Khan says it is not a political party which will field its own candidates but instead will endorse honest political candidates in the 2013 national polls. Yet another politician with a difference.

The day UPA 2 announced FDI in retail, Pankaj Pachauri, communications adviser in PMO, dropped into 24 Akbar Road for an hour-long meeting with Janardan Dwivedi. Clearly they were synchronising the party and the Government reaction to the controversial reforms. But Pachauri claims he was just visiting an old friend.

oppose anything in the morning and support it by evening."

"I'm glad the Government has announced FDI in retail. Why should Mamata, Mulayam or Akhilesh decide what is bad or good for J&K?"
