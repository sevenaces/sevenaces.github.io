GLASS HOUSE
armer MP Harish Chaudhary, 42, is Rahul Gandhi's new favourite. A former national-level baseball player, Chaudhary caught Rahul's eye when he was camping in Lucknow as Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh's aide. The postgraduate in economics from Jai Narain Vyas University, Jodhpur, quickly became part of Rahul's entourage, helping him plan his visits to other states. Never mind that he lost the state that matters most-- Uttar Pradesh.

MARK OF MAN
rime Minister Manmohan Singh has been quick to leave his mark on the finance ministry. Instead of taking quick decisions on contentious tax issues, Manmohan has appointed two committees to examine the issues and make recommendations. One committee, headed by Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations Chief Executive Parthasarathi Shome, will examine the vexed GAAR proposals announced by Pranab Mukherjee in the Union Budget. The second committee, headed by former CBDT chairman N. Rangachary, will examine taxation issues for the IT sector. The snail marches on.

MAYA'S ILLUSION
f Indian politicians think media is prone to melodrama, they should start watching Pakistani TV. Pak telly fundamentalist Maya Khan, 29, was last seen conducting a live conversion of a 20-year-old Hindu on ARY News, much to the outrage of civil society activists already concerned about the state of minorities in Pakistan. Khan is a habitual offender. In January, she was removed from Samaa TV after an outcry against her show where she hounded couples in parks holding hands. Live, and on TV.

NO TAKERS
10-member committee of ministers that probed Congress's defeat in the recent by-elections in Andhra Pradesh has made 34 recommendations to revive the ruling party. One is to launch a newspaper and television channel to promote the party line. This is tacit admission that Jagan Mohan Reddy's Sakshi TV channel and daily contributed significantly to the Congress comeback in 2009. Wonder which rich Congress MP will foot the bill this time, now that Sakshi has been forced into opposition? Infrastructure tycoons T. Subbarami Reddy of Gayatri, L. Rajagopal of Lanco and K.S. Rao of Progressive Constructions come readily to mind.

KARMIC CONNECTION

MUKHERJEE

I

t seems that P. Chidambaram and President Pranab Mukherjee have a karmic connection. On July 31, Chidambaram presented his last monthly report card as home minister. He began his statement for July by talking about his ministry coordinating Mukherjee's assumption of office as the President of India. Ironically, July 31 was also the day when the file for the minor Cabinet reshuffle was sent to the President. The President's signature was required before Chidambaram's name could be announced as finance minister, a portfolio held by Mukherjee earlier.

THE MODI EFFECT BLUE BIRTHDAY
hings are now becoming cloyingly sweet between the once estranged cousins. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray sent a large bouquet of blue roses to Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray on his 52nd birthday on July 27, delivered by Raj's aide Sachin More to Uddhav's Bandra home. Uddhav is recovering from an angioplasty. Blue was a deliberate De choice--it siga Bh r aiy a nifies trust. What next?

DARDA (LEFT); SIDDIQUI

P

raise Narendra Modi and off with your head. Samajwadi Party (SP) was so embarrassed by Shahid Siddiqui's interview with Modi for his Urdu weekly Nai Duniya that it expelled him. Siddiqui is quite a party hopper. In 2009, he left SP to contest the Bijnore seat for BSP, lost, joined RLD, then returned to the SP on the eve of Uttar Pradesh elections in 2012. Next stop, BJP? Congress has been less harsh with longtime MP Vijay Darda, who called Modi a lion. It issued a statement that it is considering action, if there is need. Could such lenient kindness have something to do with Darda's media empire?

JOKE
OF THE WEEK

Congratulations! Rohit Shekhar ke yahan baap paida hua hai. Naam rakha gaya N.D.Tiwari. Narayan, Narayan.

n July 26, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi was supposed to hold an important meeting at 11 a.m. at his home in Guwahati with top police officials on the law and order situation in the riot-hit BTAD areas. But the meeting was deferred till 4 p.m. The reason? Gogoi and his son were busy discussing the programming strategy of a news channel with the editorial team. The channel has reportedly been bought in the name of Gogoi's friend. Anything to counter Himanta Biswa Sarma, whose wife owns TV channel News Live, which aired the Guwahati molestation.

PILOT (RIGHT) ATTHE IFTAR PARTY

ajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot was planning to make up for his inept handling of the Gopalgarh firing in 2011 by attending an Iftar party for 6,000 people at Ajmer's Azad Park.That was until Jagruk Muslim Samiti, whose members are yet to be identified, pasted posters in Ajmer saying there was no difference between Gehlot and Narendra Modi. It asked: Godhra aur Gopalgarh main kya antar hai? An embarrassed Gehlot cancelled the visit. But the show went on. Union Minister of state Sachin Pilot became the star attraction.
