Now in Chanchalguda Prison, Hyderabad, he has contributed to a marble floor in the Shirdi Sai Baba temple on its premises. After all, the prison has been his home since September 2011.

RULES APART
Raj Thackeray is a great admirer of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's discipline. As long as he doesn't have to emulate him. "The BRTS in Ahmedabad is run in such a way that even Narendra Modi's car cannot enter the dedicated lane," the MNS President said at a campaign rally in Pune on February 12, ahead of the Maharashtra civic polls. Just a few hours later, traffic police fined his driver for illegally parking his car in front of a popular restaurant, Vaishali, on Fergusson College Road.

The PMO tweeted that the Government would target construction of 21 km of highways for each day of the year.The most UPA has achieved so far is 12 km a day. Have they just inverted the 1 and 2? And Kamal Nath wanted to build 20 km a day, so this is one up on him. Literally.

t is now clear that Gujarat Chief Minister and BJP's star campaigner Narendra Modi will not campaign for the party in Uttar Pradesh. All efforts to appease him and broker peace with party President Nitin Gadkari have failed. RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat also spoke to the sulking Modi, but to no avail. Modi was conspicuous by his absence even in Punjab and Uttarakhand. A senior BJP leader quipped that Modi's sadbhavna has turned into durbhavna for the party.

Fund for his constituency. Twenty other legislators have got Rs 45 crore in total. The Chief Minister hopes the former pilot will repeat his feat from Huzurnagar constituency which elected him by the widest margin, 29,194 votes, in 2009. He needs all the help he can get.

ROYAL BATTLE
Pakistani journalist Najam Sethi was delivered a very public smackdown when he tweeted that Jemima Khan was a "Jewish heiress" who had to convert to marry Imran Khan. Jemima tweeted right back that Sethi and his wife, writer Jugnu Mohsin, always had a problem with her except when seeking an invitation to a party the Khans threw for the late Princess Diana. Plus, how brave it was for Sethi to publicly disclose her religion in Pakistan's current climate of religious intolerance. Ouch.

OLDER IS BETTER
Congress may well win in Manipur but their Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, 63, is unlikely to retain his chair. Sonia Gandhi has ERABOT (LEFT) AND IBOBI asked for the bio-data of Y. Erabot Singh, the 73-year-old seniormost minister in Ibobi's Cabinet. The high command holds Ibobi responsible for ground lost during the threemonth-long blockade in 2011. Ibobi did nothing, even planning a tour of Europe which he later cancelled due to widespread criticism. Erabot became a hero in 2009 when he defied a road blockade and escorted 300 trucks carrying essentials to Imphal without police protection.

anmohan Singh got support from an unlikely quarter, Nitish Kumar. Union Minister Beni Prasad Verma may believe that at 79, Manmohan should think about making way for Rahul Gandhi. But Nitish said in Patna on February 13 that "age is no bar to politics. And the Prime Minister looks hale and hearty." Wonder what ally BJP has to say.

Each event brings in its wake a figure of fun. After the attack in Delhi on the Israeli embassy official's car, Twitter turned on Foreign Minister S.M. Krishna
 SM Krishna is happy.We have improved ties with Sri Lanka. (This after the tie with Sri Lanka in the Tri-Series at Adelaide in Australia.)  For every blast: SM Krishna condemns it, P. Chidambaram confirms it was a terror attack, Kapil Sibal blames NDA, Digvijaya Singh blames RSS while Manmohan Singh remains unaware and the matter dies.  Breaking news: SM Krishna sends a dossier to Hina Rabbani Khar for Hezbollah written in Portuguese.

U

nion Minister of State for Agriculture K.V. Thomas has been trying to get Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa's support for the much delayed Food Security Rights Bill for the last two months. With senior minister Sharad Pawar opposing the bill, Thomas is on a mission to get political support from the regional parties. But Tamil Nadu insists that the state already has an effective Public Distribution System and the new law will make the system ineffective. Thomas has shot off three letters to the Chief Minister but is yet to get a reply. Last heard, Jayalalithaa has stopped taking his calls.

T

he Ministry of Steel has been without a full-time secretary for more than a month. Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma's insistence on the appointment of an Uttar Pradesh cadre IAS officer to the post has not gone down well with the Prime Minister's Office, which is trying to ensure that ministers and secretaries of their department are not from the same state. Heavy Industries Secretary S. Sundaresan, a Kerala cadre IAS officer, has been handed additional charge of steel.
