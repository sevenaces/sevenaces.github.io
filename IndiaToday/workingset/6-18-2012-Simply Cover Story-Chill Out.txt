Iskate
You will feel a sudden dip in temperature as soon as you enter this ice skating arena. Located inside Ambience mall, Iskate recreates the magic of skating on a frozen lake. Spread across 15,000 square feet, the floor is made of real ice and its temperature is maintained by a cooling machine that's placed beneath it. Each skating session lasts for about an hour and a half, before which one is given basic tips on ice skating. One usually starts off by holding onto the side railing, getting accustomed to the floor and then slowly skating on their own (be prepared for a few falls!). A number of marshals skate along to help amateurs, whereas children can learn to slide with the help of penguin buddies--two feet tall penguins, that have rollers placed underneath them and act as a balancing tool to hold and skate. There's a DJ who gets grooving as soon as people get onto the rink, and the tempo of the music changes as skaters pick up pace. This skating arena encompasses a visitor's gallery, where one can sit and watch skaters or enjoy some grub from the food station here.

Sumer Décor
With the mercury rising, most of us resort to air-conditioners to keep our houses cool. Interior designers differ in thought and say there are other innovative options to keep your house cool too. Sapna Aggarwal, Creative director of Ansa Interiors, says, "One can easily control temperature within their home by using various methods to alter wind direction, allowing cross ventilation, using soft colours and more."

The most common method is to build terrace gardens which can be made in a creative way that can also be used for social gatherings. A terrace garden is an environment friendly choice and is not hard to maintain. She adds, "Using stone like white marble as it is low in heat absorption and hence cool to walk on is a good option." Using cool colours for the walls, bed sheets, upholstery, accessories, rugs and carpets also helps in maintaining the temperature.
