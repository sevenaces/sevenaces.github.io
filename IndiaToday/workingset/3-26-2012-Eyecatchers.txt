BIG BASH THEORY
It's wedding bells again for Sunidhi Chauhan, 28, as she prepares to marry musician Hitesh Sonik, 36. She rules our hearts with her voice, but Sonik loves her driving skills. "I love her behind the wheel," he says. While this couple is all hush-hush about wedding plans, recently married Kunal Nayyar, 31, can't stop talking about his. The Big Bang Theory's geeky Rajesh Koothrapalli married former beauty queen Neha Kapur, 28, in Delhi. The wedding with horseback rides and henna parties across a six-day ceremony was routine for us, but an exotic experience for the foreign media.
