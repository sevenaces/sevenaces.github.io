Fashion Forward
There were two fresh faces among the array of fashion designers participating in the Lakme Fashion Week 2012, in Mumbai. Khushali Kumar, 29, presented her line of evening gowns titled `Angels and a Princess'. The NIFT graduate is the daughter of late film producer and founder of T-Series Gulshan Kumar. "I want my designs on the Hollywood red carpet. Preferably on Jennifer Lopez," she says modestly. Celebrated artist Payal Khandwala, 37, returned to her first love with her jewel-toned collection `Play'. "I have always loved fashion but was overwhelmed by the idea of working with a team," says the graduate of the Parsons School of Design. Not anymore.

PAPER-PLAY
Her life is a page turner and she has now turned it into an autobiography titled Shaker. Australian female cricketer of Indian-origin Lisa Sthalekar, 32, was adopted as a three-week old baby by an AngloIndian couple from an orphanage in Pune. Shaker, which is her nickname on field, is about her life in the US, Kenya and Australia and cricket. Sthalekar captains the New South Wales team and is the first woman cricketer to have scored 1,000 runs and taken 100 wickets in ODIs.
