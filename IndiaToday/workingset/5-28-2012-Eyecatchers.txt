Changing Tune
Bharat mata ki jai from Shanghai may have managed to create a stir over its lyrics but choreographer Mansi Aggarwal, 28, had a "really nice time" filming it with a potbellied Emraan Hashmi. She choreographed for Gulaal and AGGARWAL Dev.D after Anurag Kashyap discovered her in Delhi, where she was studying economics. Aggarwal is now looking forward to working on Abhishek Kapoor's Kai Po Che, wants her own dance studio and even has a script ready. Perhaps Kashyap can step in again.

About Time
It took a thousand episodes for the makers of Balika Vadhu to give its doomed child bride some respite. Siddharth Shukla, 31, has been brought into the show as Shiv Raj Shekhar, a district collector and the man who will woo, win and, hopefully, marry Anandi. A former Grasim Manhunt winner, Shukla is known for his role of Veer in TV soap Jaane Pehchaane Se Yeh Ajnabbi and has done ads for Bajaj, ICICI and Siyarams. Let's hope he is worth the wait.


WHATAWAIST
"I feel I was born in the wrong country," says British model Scarlett Mellish Wilson, 24, the newest foreigner found swivelling her hips to Foreign Kamariya in Shanghai. She is happier shaking her booty than doing ballet and so made a beeline for Bollywood after studying performing arts at London's Tiffany Theatre College. She assisted on choreography for the TV show Chak Dhoom Dhoom and next rubs shoulders with Amy Jackson in Telugu film Yevadu with Ram Charan Teja in the lead.
