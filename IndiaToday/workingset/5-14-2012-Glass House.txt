Maa kab aayi thi

? (When did my mother come?)"This was Rahul Gandhi's first question to the villagers of Man in Satara district of Maharashtra when he visited the drought-affected area on April 28. They knew the answer, even if he didn't. Rahul's father Rajiv and mother Sonia had toured the area in 1987 and 2003 respectively. It hasn't helped that the villagers are yet to benefit from Central schemes, under which funds are provided to dig borewells and eradicate water scarcity.

CHANGE IN THE AIR

K

iran Kumar Reddy will soon be out of a job if the Congress finally summons the courage to change the status quo. According to a senior Cabinet minister, a major overhaul, both at the state and Centre, is on the cards after the Presidential elections in July. Reddy will be first to go because it is unlikely that the Congress will win in the 18 by-elections due in Andhra Pradesh in June. Sonia Gandhi hopes changing Ashok Gehlot will help salvage Rajasthan before elections in 2013. Prithviraj Chavan is the only one who may actually welcome the demotion. He prefers Raisina Hill to the Mantralaya in Mumbai.

GANDHI GOVERNORS
t's a good time to be a Gandhi family loyalist. Former SPG chief B.V. Wanchoo has been sent to Goa as governor. Another durbari,

Aziz Qureshi, has been sent to Uttarakhand, and has proclaimed his indebtedness to Sonia Gandhi. Former governor of Uttarakhand Margaret Alva has been given sensitive Rajasthan which goes to polls in 2013. She has long tired of the hills, and said so often enough. Two more posts still have to be filled-- the governor of Uttar Pradesh as well as Lt-Governor of Delhi. The buzz in Delhi is that family loyalist R.K. Dhawan, or former Union minister C.K. Jaffer Sharief may be sent to Uttar Pradesh. That hasn't stopped other loyalists from polishing their bio-datas.

GOODWILL HUNTING
.S. Jaganmohan Reddy's goodwill gestures are giving TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu some anxious moments. When Jagan was in Vijayawada to welcome former Congress MLA Vangveeti Radhakrishna, 33, into the YSR Congress on April 27, an influential TDP activist and film producer Vallabhaneni Vamsi, 42, called on him. The YSR Congress chief then called at the Hyderabad home of veteran actor Mohan Babu, a relative who has distanced himself for many years from Naidu. The call was to greet Jagan's cousin Veronica, daughter-in-law of Mohan Babu, who had delivered twins.

e has been Chief Minister of Maharashtra for over a year but Prithviraj Chavan cannot forget that he was minister of state in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) for six years. When UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on him in Mumbai on April 28 during a two-day visit to inspect Maharashtra's progress in the health sector under the UN's Millennium Development Goal Programme, Chavan urged him to look into India's proposal of an international convention on counterterrorism. It has been pending with the UN since 1996. Chavan was piloting the project when he was in the PMO.

amata Banerjee had proposed a ban on certain trade unions in the state soon after she was elected but that didn't stop Trinamool Congress's trade union wing from celebrating May Day. The party set up a meeting at Esplanade. Flipcards with photographs of martyrs of the 1886 Haymarket Massacre, considered the origin of May Day, were distributed. Present on the occasion were Panchayat Minister Subrata Mukherjee and Union Railways Minister Mukul Roy.

ttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has been busy writing letters. On April 12, he wrote as many as 12 to the Prime Minister, relating to Budget allocations and clearances of pending projects.Yadav knows these letters will not work unless sufficient pressure is put in Parliament, so he also sent copies of the letters to all his 22 Lok Sabha MPs, with a request that they raise it in the House.That's more homework for Samajwadi Party MPs than they ever expected.

ajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who also holds charge of home, can't make up his mind on fresh postings of IPS officers. On April 21, he transferred 48 officers. This offended Union Surface Transport Minister C.P. Joshi and Union Minister of State for Home Jitendra Singh, who were not taken into confidence. On April 30, early morning, Gehlot transferred 17 of these 48 again. A few hours later, he transferred three more. Police postings have two considerations: Money or politics. With polls on the way, both are priority.
