FIGHTING SPIRIT

Mangalorean actor Anushka Shetty, 30, is quite a fighter. She was a warrior princess in Telugu film Arundhati and has been chosen by director Gunashekhar to play 13th century warrior queen Rani Rudrama Devi in another Telugu film. Word is that she beat Nayanthara and Priyanka Chopra to the role.

SONG SUNG BLUE FRESH NEW FIND
Kashish Singh is seen grooving alongside Gippy Grewal in a promotional video for Punjabi film Carry On Jatta.She doesn't display any particular talent but may fare better in the untitled thriller that producer Kumar Taurani has picked her for.The Delhi girl has a bunch of commercials and did some theatre in Mumbai,but will she stand out in the ensemble cast? Monali Thakur, 26, acted when she was a child, but after becoming a finalist on Indian Idol 2 she turned to singing. Nagesh Kukunoor brings her back through Laxmi, a film about human trafficking, where she plays a young girl raped and forced into prostitution by Satish Kaushik. Grim indeed.

Going Up
Reasons to attend Mumbai Film Festival as Jaya Bachchan is conducting a masterclass in acting on October 22. Chances of watching Deepa Mehta's Midnight's Children as PVR Pictures releases it this December.


Going Down
Mallika Sherawat and Vivek Oberoi's Kismet Luv Paisa Dilli, with theatres pulling down shows in its first week. Ram Gopal Varma's secrets, in a tell-all book on him titled Vodka With Varma by Telugu lyricist Sirasiri.

SEQUEL SIREN
Australian actor Tabrett Bethell, 30, adds the foreign flavour to Dhoom 3. She has been a National Rugby League cheerleader and will most likely be paired with Uday Chopra. A good distraction for when he starts getting on our nerves.
