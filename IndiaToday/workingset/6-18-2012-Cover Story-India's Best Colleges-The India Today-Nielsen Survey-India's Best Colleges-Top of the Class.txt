t has been 15 years since INDIA TODAY first launched its Best Colleges Survey and Rankings in 1997. Much has changed in the higher education sector in India since then. The number of colleges has gone up from around 9,500 to over 30,000. The number of students enrolling for a college education has risen from 5.5 million to 16.9 million. What hasn't changed over 15 years is the discourse on higher education. In 1997, INDIA TODAY wrote about the crisis in higher education. In 2012, as the ongoing fracas over a new system of entrance exams for engineering colleges including the IITs shows, the crisis clouds loom threateningly over the higher education horizon. While the number of colleges and universities has increased with time, the country still does not have enough quality institutions of the calibre of the IITs, or of standards of St. Stephen's College, Delhi; Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi; Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi; Presidency College, Kolkata; Loyola College, Chennai; and St. Xavier's College,

Mumbai, to cater to the aspirations of the youth. These colleges and a handful of others have dominated the rankings over the last 15 years. It's not easy to dislodge the toppers but rankings should spur competition between colleges, so that each one of the 30,000 in India lifts it standards and strives to be among the top 100, if not top 10. For the Government, it is easiest to create the appearance of level-playing field by diluting quality at the top. That is precisely what the aim of the common entrance exam for all Government-financed engineering colleges, overriding the objections of various IITs, is about. In our view, India's colleges should not be forced into a race to the bottom. Instead, they should be competing in a race to the top. This year, we have expanded the Best Colleges Survey and Rankings for the first time in a decade. The 2012 survey includes five new streams in addition to the traditional arts, science, commerce, engineering, medicine and law. The addition of these new streams --Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA), Mass Communication and Journalism, Fine Arts and Fashion Technology--is recognition of the diversification in the higher education space. Two decades after liberalisation, there is a growing demand for newer professional degrees which enable the youth to find lucrative jobs. The growth in demand for the five new streams is directly correlated with a boom in certain sectors of the Indian economy. The BCA, a unique made-inIndia degree, trains undergraduate students to become programmers. A job in the IT sector follows easily. Students who graduate with a BBA supplement the growing demand for managers which is not fully met by MBA students alone. Journalism and the mass media are a rapidly growing space. India is one of the few countries in the world where print media continues to grow strongly, along with electronic and digital media. Indian fashion and Indian art have finally found the global spotlight in the last five years. The domestic market for high-end fashion and art will always be limited at India's current levels of per

capita income, but access to a global market has created a boom and prospects for the youth. The diversification of choices in higher education is an opportunity for new institutions to make a mark. In the late 1990s, the National Law School of India University in Bangalore filled a vacant space by offering a law education to students straight out of school. Many of the colleges in our top 25 rankings in law, including NALSAR, Hyderabad, did not exist in 1997 when INDIA TODAY conducted its first best colleges survey. Relatively new institutions have made their presence felt in the 2012 rankings for BBA and BCA. Two institutions which feature in the top five in both streams, Christ University, Bangalore and SRM University, Chennai, are private sector deemed universities which have done an excellent job of providing top-class infrastructure. Younger institutions tend to be more nimble than their older counterparts and are quick to adapt to demand for new courses. St. Stephen's College, Delhi, does not offer a BCom degree more than 125 years after its founding. In the long run, the education system will be driven by institutions in the private sector without Government aid. The Government must perform the job of regulation, to ensure that fly-bynight institutions do not destroy the edifice of quality. Unfortunately, a Bill to create a new independent regulator for higher education, The National Commission for Higher Education and Research, which will replace the discredited University Grants Commission and All India Council on Technical Education, is still pending passage in Parliament. The Bill's passage is crucial to provide a modicum of stability to the regulatory apparatus. The Government must also evolve a consensus on the Foreign Universities Bill so that India can host some of the world's best universities. At any rate, the Government must let private institutions flourish and compete. The INDIA TODAY rankings 15 years on, in 2027, will hopefully reflect that endeavour.
