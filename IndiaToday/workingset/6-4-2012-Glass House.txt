NEW GEAR
he mercurial Congressman T. Subbarami Reddy, 68, has moved from bizarre to ridiculous. He wore an Arab dress while campaigning for the June 12 by-election to the Lok Sabha from Nellore. His opponent, Mekapati Rajamohan Reddy, who resigned the seat to contest again on a YSR Congress ticket, is likely to win. Subbarami has won twice before, but did not need an Arab camouflage; a Congress ticket was sufficient. This time, under pressure, he chose to woo the 6 per cent Muslim vote with attire gifted by the Bara Shaheed Dargah in Hyderabad. But God has been kind in one way; He will continue to be an MP even if he loses. He is in Rajya Sabha till summer of 2014.

ujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar finally have something in common. Nitish is getting the Bihar State Renewable Development Agency to install a Rs 4.5-crore solar power system at his official home at 1 Anne Marg in Patna. The solar plates will generate 100 units of electricity per day. Modi's house in Gandhinagar has two plants which produce 80 units per day. Now that's an ideal power duo.

he highlight of the May 16 Maharashtra Cabinet meeting was an argument between state Home Minister R.R. Patil and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar on raising fodder subsidy to farmers from Rs 78 to Rs 100 in drought-hit areas. Patil said yes, Pawar, no. The highlight of next day's newspapers was a full and accurate report of their spat. So much for official secrecy.

Vote for Baba Ramdev. He'll be the PM who can help you make your ends meet.Your head and toe, that is. Mayawati, Jayalalithaa and Mamata should now form an alliance.They can call it BehenjiAmma-Didi. Not BAD, right? PM says India and China are good friends.Of course we are.We have so much in common. Like Arunachal Pradesh.

WIRED UP
he Government is in a bind over who to appoint as the next commerce secretary after Rahul Khullar left to become chairman of TRAI on May 14. The two frontrunners for the job are secretary, financial services, D.K. Mittal, and former chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh, Anoop Mishra. Some quarters are hoping that Finance Secretary R.S. Gujral, under fire for the controversial retrospective tax amendment, may be moved to commerce. In the interim, Industry Secretary Saurabh Chandra holds additional charge of commerce.

NEW TUNE

here was considerable consternation when Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, 65, was rushed to Chandigarh's Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER) on May 16. Was it a heart attack? Not so, said PGIMER doctors. It was merely hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Says Hooda: "It is true that I have pain in my chhaati (chest), but it is for the people whose welfare my government and I are committed to." In politics, nothing, not even illness, is personal.

YADAV AT A LAW AND ORDER MEETING IN LUCKNOW

SWEPT AWAY
ld brooms will be used to sweep Lucknow clean. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has decided to redeploy 5,634 daily wage earners hired in May 2011 to maintain Mayawati's parks and memorials in Lucknow, Noida and Greater Noida, to keep the city a bit cleaner."We have decided to shift focus away from stones and memorials to development," said Yadav to the media on May 20 at the Vidhan Sabha. We'd like to see that happening.

engal's famed depth of culture is getting a bit frayed in the cauldron of politics. First, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee played Rabindranath Tagore at traffic intersections in Kolkata. This has been topped by her party's anthem, a two-minute Maa, Maati, Manush song penned by Bengali band Chandrabindoo's lead vocalist Anindya Chatterjee. It has already made its debut on all local FM stations. Is this what they mean by poriborton in Kolkata?
