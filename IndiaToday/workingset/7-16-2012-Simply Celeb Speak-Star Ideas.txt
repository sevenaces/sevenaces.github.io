The place I visit the most is Set'z, a multi-cuisine haven. Their live cooking stations whip up the best of Japanese and Thai food. For succulent kebabs, it has to be Bukhara and if I'm in mood for some non-fussy Italian food, I head to Tonino at MG Road. The place serves some of the best pizzas in town.

There is a platter for every palate in this city--everything from swanky restaurants to street options has something unique to offer. A favourite for me is Shiro, which is a great place to hang out with friends as well as to indulge in their pan-Asian delights.

To find the best food, one should head to Old Delhi. Join the crowd at the Natraj Dahi Bhalla corner for its fluffy, light and delicious treats topped with spices and coriander. Across the road find the world famous Nem Chand Jalebi Wala, simply known as `Dilliwalle ki Jalebi'. You cannot miss the legendary Karim's--the kebabs here are made using the recipes of Bahadur Shah Zafar's chef.
