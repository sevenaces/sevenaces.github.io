CHANAKYA IAS ACADEMY

SUCCESS MANTRA FOR CIVII SERVICES
· hanakya IAS academy's past performance has been glorious. The academy is steadfastly committed to quality guidance and holistic training to the civil services aspirants. The academy's extraordinary results over the years, highly encouraging response from the students, parents and teachers and the successful running of its branches in different parts of country are indicators of our success in this field. Over the years the nature of civil services examination has undergone significant changes. The competition has certainly become stiffen Over the past few years, it was realized that the traditional method of coaching no longer fulfils the requirement of the Civil Services Exam in the neo-competitive era. So, while entering its 20 year of successful running, Chanakya IAS Academy has made a significant/remarkable shift from coaching to comprehensive training. Most coaching Institutes normally commit for covering of UPSC subject & GS Syllabus and they stop at that. The first USP of Chanakya is that besides its commitment to cover the given syllabus, it endeavors to shape the personality of aspirants required for administrative jobs. The results of the past 7 years stand a testimony to this IAS Coaching Institute's glorious performance in guiding students in the Civil Services Exam. The Academy imparts its class-room training through six of its study centres - two in Delhi and one each in Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Ranch! and Jaipur. In addition to imparting knowledge of the concerned subjects, Chanakya IAS Academy lays great emphasis on leadership development, ethics and social responsibility, and mind-power development so as to ensure that tomorrow's bureaucrats do not suffer from moral and ethical bankruptcy. Chanakya has decoded and demystified the CSAT exam by developing ten customised modules with the help of top professionals.
