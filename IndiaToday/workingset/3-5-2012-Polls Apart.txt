It seems Madhya Pradesh politics is being played out in Uttar Pradesh.After campaigning in Uttar Pradesh for BJP, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur has predicted that SP will emerge as the largest party, followed by BSP, and BJP will maintain its third place. Gaur's candour has caught his party off guard. Its official position is that it will form the government on its own.

MAKE OR BREAK
hile this is being touted as a make-orbreak election for Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi, a lot is at stake for BJP President Nitin Gadkari as well. "I have put in everything in these elections," he says, en route to Chitrakoot in a helicopter on February 17. Gadkari is confident that the party will do better than expected. "There is a strong undercurrent in favour of the BJP. The party is not in the race for third or fourth spot

he Rashtriya Lok Dal organised two public meetings in Meerut on February 16, one with party chief Ajit Singh as the chief speaker and the other with his son, Jayant Chaudhary. Party functionaries announced that film star Raveena Tandon would grace both the rallies. Sources later revealed that the only intention was to keep the crowds hooked. Tandon might have been a ruse but there was no dearth of entertainment for the crowd at both rallies,

as speculated by the media, but for the first and the second spot." Gadkari comes up for re-election as BJP president in end-December. Despite what he says, if he manages a respectable third place in the polls for the party, then his re-election is a given. Which is why he has emerged as the BJP star campaigner and chief strategist. He ensured the return of RSS functionary Sanjay Joshi and temperamental sanyasin and OBC mascot Uma Bharati. Both, he says, are proving to be invaluable for the party. by Bhavna Vij-Aurora

It's the first sign of change. On February 19, when Mayawati went to cast her vote in Booth No. 235 at the Lucknow Montessori School, she was all smiles, waving at voters and even stopping to pose for the photographers. "Ma'am we love you, hope you win," said a 30-something housewife, Shradha Sawhney, who had waited for over an hour to get a glimpse of the Chief Minister. Mayawati refused to answer any questions and, flanked by loyal lieutenants Satish Mishra and Shashank Shekhar, left the minute the photo-op was over. But there was a sudden rethink. She retraced her steps to tell the waiting media, "These elections will be even better than 2007. I am saying this judging by the utsaah (enthusiasm) I see in the crowds at my rallies." It's not just the media that the Bahujan Samaj Party president is

suddenly reaching out to. Even junior-level party coordinators are now getting calls directly from Behenji. Earlier, she would pass instructions either through Public Works Department Minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui or Jugal Kishore, the powerful party coordinator. Now BSP coordinators are expected to wake up at 5 a.m. and wait for her call, says a party leader from Siddharth Nagar. They are assigned new responsibilities by Mayawati immediately after campaigning ends in their area. She also personally verifies whether her instructions are being implemented. In a last-minute effort to improve her image, Mayawati's aides have been calling TV channels and offering short interviews with the Chief Minister. But there is a catch. The reporters are also prodded on what questions to ask. Clearly, a sign of desperation. by Priya Sahgal

BET-O-METER
After the fourth phase, the Samajwadi Party (SP) is the bookies' clear favourite: Rate for a single party government is Rs 2.50 for every rupee, which means it is impossible. President's Rule: Rate is 20 paise per rupee, which suggests it is very likely.
SP: 130 seats. Rate is 25 paise per rupee, which translates to almost certain. Rate for 150 seats is 40 paise, which is possible. BSP: Over 100 seats. Rate is 40 paise per
