MALLIKA SHERAWAT

Jalebi Bai In barely there cholis and see-through lehengas, Mallika Sherawat twirled and swirled her hips to make jalebis in the air for Double Dhamaal. Well, at least she wasn't tweeting about meeting Barack Obama. Chikni Chameli Katrina Kaif made the transition from Sheila to Chikni in Agneepath in one smooth move, giving a leg up to the traditional Lavani.

We wanted to win it for Sachin
From Zaheer Khan to Gautam Gambhir, Harbhajan Singh to Virat Kohli, that was the phrase the entire cricket team had on AFP its lips, as it lifted the World Cup after a stunning victory.We'd like to think it was much the same for most of India as well.

FACE PALM MOMENTS
They embarrassed themselves, and us, by walking into trouble
Ghulam Nabi Azad The Union Health Minister should have stopped after declaring that men having sex with men (MSM) was unnatural. However, he went on to add that it was a `disease that has come to India from foreign shores'.

AZAD
YASBANT NEGI

S.M. Krishna External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna read his Portuguese counterpart's speech for three minutes at the UN Security Council meeting, till it was brought to his proverbial attention.

Vasuki Sunkavalli India's Miss Universe hopeful tweeted columnist Sadanand Dhume's posts as her own till he pointed out clearly: "Beauty pageant ethics ain't what they used to be. At least seven of Miss India Universe 2011 @vasukisunkavalli's 29odd tweets lifted from me..."

Why this Kolaveri Di?
Half-Tamil, half-English, disconnected words. It became a rage, with 17 million hits online.

Zero Loss
Kapil Sibal's description of the 2G loss became part of the political lexicon. Prescreen, his other favourite word for censoring Internet content, was a close contender.

PAWAR

SUNKAVALLI

Sharad Pawar His unsuspecting face met Harvinder Singh's angry palm to create a unique face palm moment. The rest of India was disconcertingly delighted.

ACCESSORIES OF THE YEAR
A handbag. A shoe. How our celebrities carried their style.

Mayawati's sandals came into the limelight after WikiLeaks leaked that she had her favourite pair flown in from Mumbai on a chartered flight. The Gandhi cap became synonymous with Anna Hazare and the fight against corruption. Along with `I am Anna', it became the fashion fad of the year. 3D glasses They became a must-have with every other film jumping on to the 3D bandwagon. The trend even followed us home with 3D television sets and cameras.
SIPRA DAS

DK Bose
An innocuous sounding Bengali name became a popular North Indian slur in a song, Bhaag DK Bose, and caught the nation's imagination. It made lyricist Amitabh Bhattacharyya the new bard of the young. Especially when he followed it with the Airtel jingle, Har ek friend zaroori hota hai.

Hina Rabbani Khar's Birkin bag stole the show during the Pakistan Foreign Minister's India visit. We didn't mean to leave out the Roberto Cavalli shades and pearls, but she did leave in a huff the last time we discussed them.
HINA RABBANI KHAR

Poschim Bongo
Of all the renaming fits that seize politicians, Mamata Banerjee had the worst one when she renamed Bengal.There would have been greater outrage had more people been able to get their tongue around this one.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan The birth of Beti B, as papa Abhishek calls her, was the most debated and watched event of the year. From bookies betting on lucky dates to the gender of the child, the former Miss World's private moment turned into a public spectacle. After self-restraint notices by television news channels, the news of the birth was finally announced by the proud father as he tweeted, "It's a girl".

OOPS THEY DID IT
In 2011, Hindi films went boldly where they hadn't gone before
Oral sex Imran Khan went down on girlfriend Shehnaz Treasurywala in Delhi Belly. It was under decorous covers, but enough to get it an `A' certificate. Masturbation Bejoy Nambiar's dark Shaitan had Neil Bhoopalam masturbating, not to forget hand jobs by Kalki in That Girl In Yellow Boots. Orgasm Vidya Balan oohed and aahed all the way through what was a deliciously dirty picture. A woman's kiss Katrina Kaif kissed a stunned Hrithik Roshan in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara because, as she said, `Mujhe afsos karna nahin aata'.
