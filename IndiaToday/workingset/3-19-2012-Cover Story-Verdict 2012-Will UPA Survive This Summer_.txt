fall from grace is par for the course. A slide into humiliation is another discourse. Defeat is the familiar price of failure in democracy. Humiliation is retribution for a more dangerous sin, arrogance. Parties often blossom after an election victory, as Congress did after 2004; very few retain any relationship with reality after re-election. The trap of 2012 was set in 2009. Rahul Gandhi sought to win his electoral spurs in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh on the road to the Prime Minister's office. After two years of effort and expense, he has just discovered that he has neither horse nor direction along the Gangetic belt. Family, in these egalitarian times, is an inadequate rationale for office. Dynasties are loath to admit mistakes, since they damage their principal claim to power, mystique. Even a punctured prince must be praised, therefore, if for nothing else than hard work, as if hard work is perfectly understandable for mortals like Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati but a labour of love for a prince. Everyone works hard in an election. Defeat cannot be a prince's fault: Candidates were wrong, or the party was to

blame and not a whisper about who chose the candidates, or who was in charge of building the party. A curtain of alibis becomes a tattered cloak. Rahul Gandhi is not young. At his age, 41, his great grandfather Jawaharlal presided over the historic 1929 Lahore session and pushed through, despite the scepticism of his mentor Mahatma Gandhi, the swaraj resolution which formally committed the Congress to complete independence from the British. Jawaharlal soared ahead in national esteem on the wing of ideas, not slogans undercooked by trainee chefs who do not know the difference between hot air and nourishment. Jawaharlal was an intellectual who bridged a formidable library with the poverty of a village, and was at home in both environments. He learnt his politics from peasant and Mahatma, as well as from the prescriptions of an ancient sage he so admired, Chanakya. When in 321 BC Chandragupta sought to overthrow Mahapadma Nanda [`the son of a barber'], Chanakya offered some sensible advice: Remember how your mother taught you to eat a hot chapatti--begin from the edges.

when the next President of India is elected. If the Congress fails to get its candidate through, the party might not be over, but the Government will be. During its first term, when Pranab Mukherjee was in charge of UPA's security, he played off friend, foe and the large grey mass in the middle with finesse and dexterity; he postponed any budding problem till the point where the advantage tipped in the Congress's favour. After 2009, the Congress has done everything to alienate its allies, and snub those it might have reached out to. Others have, as a consequence, created space in the middle, where even parties within the ruling alliance can occasionally rest when tired of being nice to Congress. Those who do not dare step out, like DMK, are as sullen as scapegoats. Congress has used tax authorities to blackmail partners into good behaviour, not the best way to bond. Those without any option but silence, become good at waiting for their moment. That moment could be this summer. In straight political mathematics, association with Congress is slowly turning into a liability. Congress leaders like spokesman Manish Tewari are beginning to admit that there is sweeping urban resentment against the party. This is, once again, a reversal from UPA 1, when Congress added value to an ally's vote base. But the decisive impetus will come from the Agatha Christie question: Who benefits from death in the drawing room, or, in a more straightforward simile, the

Rahul Gandhi's strategy, literally and metaphorically, was the reverse. He operated from the centre. From the comfort of a power perch in Delhi, he converted the chapatti into a jigsaw puzzle. His advisers thought each geographical or demographic piece could be adjusted by money, legislative illusion or emotional patronage. From this emerged a campaign of smoke and mirrors. A cash award was assigned to Bundelkhand. The Dalit heart was meant to melt at the sight of a prince dropping in for a meal. Rahul Gandhi's problem is not that he is young, but that he continued to play with toy soldiers in his electoral war room. Gestures became a substitute for substance. He rolled up his sleeves. He toyed with the length of his beard. I trust that Rahul Gandhi is not going to tear up any opponent's manifesto for a long time. The biggest play was made for the Muslim vote, with promises that were tainted with compromise. The dust of reservations was thrown into the eye and pantomime paraded as drama. Second rank Congress leaders began to compete for awards in histrionics. Those with literary fantasies offered little drops of blood to fertilise seeds of future glory. The only astute player in this game was the Muslim voter: On a bulk level, he drove Mulayam

Singh Yadav to office, and in constituencies where strategic voting made more sense, he elected fellow Muslims across labels. This UP Assembly will see the highest number of Muslim MLAs, 69. Every major party--SP, BSP and Congress--will have the same percentage of Muslim MLAs, between 20 to 30 per cent. After all the huff and puff, Congress has four Muslims in its total of 28. The Peace Party has three out of its four. There should be a lesson in this somewhere. Congress President Sonia Gandhi thought the crisis was serious enough to merit that rare indulgence called a press conference. She let slip a thought that should trouble her colleagues, that the problem was too many leaders rather than lack of leadership. But we shall let the party worry about that. Her more substantive comment was that UPA still had time to correct its mistakes, since the next General Elections were in 2014. It is possible that news from Kolkata had not reached her. Her ally, Mamata Banerjee, publicly celebrated Mulayam Singh Yadav's victory in Uttar Pradesh. This does not quite sound like a ringing endorsement of UPA as it presently exists. Long before the General Elections of 2014, there will be an electoral test for UPA, in July this year,

to what it used to be, liberal in spirit and democratic in ethos. It can either be a national trust or family property, not both. The fact that other parties are run by families is irrelevant. There were many turning points in the UP election. One of them was the arrival of Priyanka Gandhi's husband Robert Vadra and her still young children to Rae Bareli. The electorate was being given advance notice for 2030. I don't know what voters will do in 2030, but we know now what they did in 2012. In 1739, the Persian butcher-marauder Nadir Shah shrugged aside token military resistance outside Delhi, occupied the Mughal capital and ordered that the khutba at the Friday prayers be read in his name, acknowledgement that he was overlord of the wretched Mughal emperor, Muhammad Shah Alam Rangila. Persian nobles laughed and coined a doggerel: Hukumat-e Shah Alam, Az Dilli ta Palam. The translation is not inspiring: The rule of Shah Alam stretches from Delhi to Palam. If Congress loses Rajasthan, that will be the extent of its realm in north India.

Shamed in his battlefield, Rahul has to wait till 2019
By Priya Sahgal

The Crown Prince Cracks

The day the Congress lost Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi underwent yet another makeover. It was not the angry young man but a sheepish youth who met the media on the afternoon of March 6. Still sporting a beard, he said, "I led the campaign so it (the defeat) is my responsibility." And then added on a surprisingly mature note, "the result is a good lesson for me". With a pat on the back for one journalist and a wave for another, he walked back to 10 Janpath where Priyanka consoled her beaten brother with a hug. A Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh was supposed to be the first step towards Rahul's coronation as prime minister.

This is the reason why he was not projected as the chief ministerial candidate in the state despite the demand from many candidates. "We were told that Rahul Gandhi was a national leader who could not be limited to one state," says a party candidate from Allahabad who lost his seat. The shame of Uttar Pradesh has put Rahul's national ambitions on hold. Rahul has already shifted his war room to Gujarat. The elections in that state are due early next year, along with Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. All three states are ruled by the BJP but it is Gujarat that will be the trophy win. If Rahul manages to wrest this state away from Narendra Modi then he will regain much of the glory he lost in Uttar Pradesh. Given the Congress's dependence on dynasty, Rahul will remain the party's star campaigner for 2014. But whether he is projected as the party's prime ministerial candidate will depend on how the Congress fares in these elections as well as the next round of polls in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan which are due at the end of 2013. If there is a repeat of the current scorecard, then it is likely that Rahul will postpone his prime ministerial ambitions to 2019 and instead opt for

a Manmohan Singh-Sonia Gandhi kind of arrangement. Already SMS jokes are doing the rounds claiming that the Uttar Pradesh defeat has given Manmohan a fresh lease of political tenure. Interestingly, when asked on March 7 who would be Congress's prime ministerial candidate in 2014, Sonia Gandhi was evasive, saying, "This is 2012." "Rahul could easily have helicoptered into the prime minister's position. Instead, he chose to work from the ground and chose the most difficult terrain of all," Congress veteran Mani Shankar Aiyar told the media. He recalled how the Congress had lost Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in 1983 under the late Rajiv Gandhi's leadership. Yet Rajiv's position within the Congress remained unassailable. Similarly, no one has blamed Rahul for the current debacle. Instead, sundry Congress leaders are falling over themselves to take the blame. Rahul has tripped before. He led the party's disastrous Bihar campaign in 2010. He is still to promote a state-level leadership there. But Uttar Pradesh was a bigger shock than Bihar. This is a state that he had made into his karmbhoomi.

A Congress general secretary points out that he will soon be visiting Uttar Pradesh again and is keen to prop up a line of local leadership. According to him, Rahul is considering projecting one of the three Union ministers--RPN Singh, Jitin Prasada or Pradeep Jain--as the state Congress chief. One of the lessons Rahul has learnt from Uttar Pradesh is the importance of a credible state leader. The current state leadership, such as it is, comprises of Congress Legislature Party leader Pramod Tewari and Pradesh Congress Committee chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi. Both cannot win a seat outside their own constituency. Explains a local Congress leader, "Ritaji knows how her father (H.N. Bahuguna) was cut to size by Indiraji. She knows how dangerous it is to be a tall leader in the Congress." Rahul had revelled in his self-appointed role as the great saviour of the cow belt. He now knows that his hit-and-run visits to the state have not worked. What the Congress needs is a strong local leadership if it wants to make a comeback. Rahul's patronising brand of politics--promising a package for one section of Uttar Pradesh, engineering reservations for another and propping up a caste icon for a third--has clearly been rejected by the state. The problem with Rahul is that he thinks in English and then translates his thoughts into Hindi. This is what led to the faux pas when he referred to the people of Uttar Pradesh as beggars during his November 14 rally in Phulpur. "What he meant was that Uttar Pradesh should provide enough employment opportunities so that its residents don't have to look for work outside," explains a Lucknow-based Congressman. Unfortunately, this is not quite how it sounded. Because of this communication gap, instead of creating an emotional connect with the voter, Rahul's speeches often have the air of a patronising sermon. Sonia Gandhi has said that the problem in Uttar Pradesh was that there were "too many leaders". If Rahul wants to

succeed as a party leader, he needs to re-evaluate his team of advisers. After the elections, Rahul told a select section of the media that he had wanted to be projected as the chief ministerial candidate but his party leaders advised him against it. Rahul should have just gone with his instincts instead of allowing himself to be misled. Moreover, Mayawati has pointed out that the Congress party's politics of quota only succeeded in pushing the Muslim vote firmly towards the Samajwadi Party (SP). It was Cabinet minister Salman Khurshid and senior leader Digvijaya Singh who were the proponents of this quota politics. "We only talked about 4.5

Considering that this look was the brainchild of Raj Babbar, another actor from the Amitabh generation, it is not surprising he got it so wrong. Although Sonia had kept in the background allowing her son to lead the party in the recent round of Assembly elections, the debacle has forced her to emerge from the shadows. She reprimanded Congressmen to "pull up their socks". She could have added a footnote to this sartorial advice: And stop rolling up your sleeves!

per cent reservation, the SP talked of 18 per cent. So how can you say it harmed us?" asks Digvijaya. But his trigger-happy statements made a serious dent in the Congress campaign. If it was not Digvijaya talking about imposing Governor's Rule, it was Khurshid claiming that Sonia had wept when she saw pictures of the Batla House encounter. Eager to jump onto this bandwagon, another Cabinet minister, Sriprakash Jaiswal, claimed that "Rahul could become prime minister at midnight if he so desired". It is this kind of arrogance that the voter of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa and even to a great extent Uttarakhand, has rejected. The Gandhis no longer have the dynastic right to rule, not even in the pocket-boroughs of Amethi and Rae Bareli. Moreover, Rahul's angry young man persona, complete with the bearded look and rolled up kurta sleeves, puzzled the Uttar Pradesh electorate instead of galvanising them. "Amitabh Bachchan's angry young

Celebrations broke out in Parkash Singh Badal's village on the afternoon of March 6 as poll results announced a surprising comeback for the octogenarian Chief Minister. He climbed onto an open jeep and did a 30-minute victory lap around Badal, the village where he started his political life as a sarpanch in 1947. He was accompanied by a crowd beating drums--the sound of victory. In contrast, the sounds of celebration that had resounded around the house of Amarinder Singh, the Congress's chief ministerial candidate, ever since polling day on January 30, abruptly fell silent after the first 15 minutes of counting on March 6. The first leads broadcast on TV showed the Congress in front with 11 versus Shiromani Akali DalBharatiya Janata Party's (SAD-BJP) two. But it progressed rapidly into early indications of a big win for the ruling combine. For the last 40 years, Punjab had been switching between Akali and Congress governments. Amarinder had been so sure it was now his turn that he even scheduled a victory press conference at noon. Instead, he offered his resignation as state party chief "if Sonia Gandhi so advises". At the beginning of the campaign, he had declared this would be his last election. "I'm turning 70 this year, I don't see myself fighting another election," he had said. Amarinder's defeat has already set opportunist Congressmen lobbying to become next chief-minister-in-waiting, come elections in 2017. The Punjab defeat has shocked the Congress out of its born-to-rule stupor. It had hoped to wipe out an indifferent performance in Uttar Pradesh with a win in Punjab and Uttarakhand. Acknowledging that despite being in the Opposition, the state unit was burdened by an anti-incumbency targeted at the Congress-ruled Government at the Centre, Ludhiana's "deeply disappointed" MP and AICC spokesperson Manish Tewari conceded: "There is a sullen anti-Congress mood across urban India." Privately, most Congress leaders agree with him. What is also worrying is

the cocoon which the party leadership has wrapped itself in. Sonia has said that the current results will have no impact on the stability of UPA 2. Maybe not in numbers, as Mulayam Singh Yadav has stated that he continues to support the Congress at the Centre to stave off BJP. But the recent poll defeat will certainly affect the quality of governance. With the Congress having little hope of bettering its figure of 209 MPs in the current Lok Sabha, the party will need to tone down its big brotherly attitude towards regional leaders if it wants their help to stay in power after the next General Elections. What is worrying Congressmen is that unlike Sonia, her son has little rapport with regional leaders. The only regional ally Rahul has an equation with is Omar Abdullah, whose own popularity is on the wane. Sonia Gandhi understated the loss to the media, saying, "We had better hope for Punjab." Instead of introspection, she preferred to blame Manpreet Badal's People's Party of Punjab (PPP). "PPP damaged us in 23 seats," she said. To an extent she is right. Despite Manpreet's attempts to forge a viable third alternative, all he managed to do was draw the anti-incumbency votes away from Congress. But, as in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress campaign in Punjab was flawed. Unlike the Samajwadi Party and the Akali Dal, the party failed to reinvent with the times. The triumph of SAD-BJP, says Pramod Kumar, director of Chandigarh's Institute for Development & Communication, comes amid "a significant reinvention of the Akali Dal's traditional agenda". Finally seeking closure with its postOperation Bluestar politics, the party steered clear of divisive panthic slogans and instead opted for populism and development. SAD also socially re-engineered itself to co-opt urban Hindus. Significantly, nine of the 12 Hindus, who for the first time found a place in SAD's candidates list, won their elections. In contrast, Amarinder and his men promised their supporters retribution for the repression unleashed upon

them and a promise to "teach the Akalis a lesson". But they failed to show people their own futuristic vision in the state. The party's manifesto, a watered down version of SAD's noholds-barred populism, too fell short of building a credible and proactive alternative to Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal's development agenda. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, too, is closely identified with Punjab. Such was the anger against UPA that there were few demands for him to campaign in his home state. Sonia has admitted the price hike could be one of the reasons for the defeat. Other ministers from the state like Pawan Bansal, Ambika Soni, Ashwani Kumar--and even Kapil Sibal's Punjabi credentials--failed to sway the voter.

Mayawati manages to preserve her social core
By S. Prasannarajan

Fallen But Intact

Defeat shatters the illusion. On the day after the mandate that brought her down from the make-believe of invincibility to the harsh reality of rejection and humiliation, Mayawati looked more human, unlike her inanimate marble doubles. When she walked in to face the media in Lucknow, the imperial gait was missing, and when she spoke, the words were not disembodied commandments meant for the consumption of a servile gaggle of reporters. She answered the questions, rather suffered them, with the kind of modesty that was not associated with yesterday's Empress of Awadh. And in deconstructing her own fall, she was more clinical than emotional: "Across the state, the Dalits have voted for the BSP. That is why the BSP is Number 2. Otherwise my position would have been like Lalu's in Bihar." She is right. She has

lost Uttar Pradesh but more or less retained her base. Statistics vindicate her. The difference in vote share between the SP and the BSP is just 3.3 per cent, though Mayawati's current tally of 25.9 per cent is 4.5 per cent less than her share in the 2007 Assembly elections. Then, 2007 was as much a landslide for her as 2012 is for Mulayam. Otherwise, in the last two General Elections and in the latest poll, Mayawati's vote has not fluctuated drastically; it has varied between 24 and 27 per cent. The imperishable--and effortlessly transferable--social vote is something unique in politics, but Dalits alone cannot win the state for her. And she should know that by the magnitude of her victory in 2007 and the velocity of her fall five years later. Here too, Mayawati is her party's best pundit: "Finding the Congress weak and the OBC and upper castes pro-BJP, Muslims en masse voted for the SP. Seventy per cent of the Muslims voted for the SP." The mathematics of caste, though, doesn't tell the entire story. It also doesn't explain why Mayawati, whose every day in office in the last five years was a preparation for March 6, failed to sway the rural poor. This failure only magnifies the limits of the singular leader of a party built on the aspirations and empowerment of the dispossessed. The development index of Uttar Pradesh defies the stereotype of the misgoverned badlands. During Mayawati's reign, the state registered a growth rate of 7.28 per cent, just below the national average of 8.15 per cent; and remember, in the previous 10 years, when India grew at a rate of 7.4 per cent, the Uttar Pradesh average was a dismal 4.4 per cent. The growth index was not

matched by the happiness index, a far more powerful vote gatherer. She has none to blame but her own imperial self. The more she retreated into the fortress of 5 Kalidas Marg in Lucknow, the more she distanced herself from the hearts of the voters who celebrated her in 2007. No leader steeped in the kitsch of social justice can take the people for granted--ask J. Jayalalithaa, or Lalu Prasad. The only glimmer in the debris for Mayawati is that Dalits have not entirely abandoned her, and she, still one of India's most powerful politicians, has five years to arm herself for the next fight. Powerlessness may even humanise her further.

Mixed fortune brings out BJP's crisis of leadership
By Bhavna Vij-Aurora

Eternal Wait for a Leader

Jubilant leaders rushed to BJP President Nitin Gadkari's home as early trends in Uttar Pradesh indicated that the party was in the second spot, behind Samajwadi Party (SP). RSS leader Ram Lal and party General Secretary Ananth Kumar were among the first ones to arrive at Gadkari's 13, Teen Murti Lane on March 6. Gadkari asked them to wait. It was too early to be in a self-congratulatory mood. He was working the phones in his study-cum-office, inquiring how

the key candidates were performing, even as he flipped channels on the 40 inch LCD television. In restrospect, it was a wise move. By noon, it was clear that the party would have to settle for the third spot in Uttar Pradesh with 47 seats (four less than the last time) in the 403member Assembly. Gadkari took a call to give the verdict a positive spin: Look at the bigger picture, focus on victories in Punjab and Goa, and the near-victory in Uttarakhand. In Uttar Pradesh, the strategy was to highlight the poor performance of the Congress. His entry at the party headquarters for a media briefing later in the day was heralded by bursting of crackers and beating of dhols. The message was unequivocal. The party was celebrating its victories and not wallowing in the Uttar Pradesh defeat. But Gadkari was disappointed with the poor showing of the party in Uttar Pradesh. For him, elections in the state were a personal project. He was involved in it since August 2011, when he decided to bring back RSS functionary and former BJP organisational secretary Sanjay Joshi into the party, and give him the charge of the party's campaign for Uttar Pradesh elections. Gadkari personally vetted each and every candidate before handing out the party ticket. He went about the task in a systematic manner after working out the social profile and caste intricacies of each seat. He ensured the return of Uma Bharati with the firm backing of the RSS. Gadkari also welcomed four BSP discards into the party, including NRHM scam-accused Babu Singh Kushwaha. Both, Bharati and Kushwaha were brought in to woo the OBCs and enlarge the party vote bank. None of them seemed to have worked to BJP's advantage. There was simmering resentment about all these decisions within the party. Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley admitted on February 27 that there were differences within the party over Joshi's re-induction. It was the main reason why party's star campaigner Narendra Modi stayed away from Uttar Pradesh. Though Gadkari tried to play down Modi's absence from the state, BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi admitted that people missed Modi. "It would have been better if Modi had joined the election campaign in Uttar Pradesh," he said. Even the idea of putting the divisive sanyasin in the state left most of the local leaders in Uttar Pradesh unhappy. The entry of Kushwaha was the most controversial decision as all senior party leaders, including Bharati, felt that it affected the BJP's strong stand against corruption.

H

owever, Gadkari remained unfazed by the criticism. Even during ticket distribution, he left many senior Uttar Pradesh leaders unhappy by not accommodating their candidates. "Taking decisions based on likes and dislikes of leaders is against the party's culture and ideology. We sat for 10 entire nights, discussing each and every seat and possible winnable candidate. Tickets were given only on merit,'' he asserted at the media briefing on March 6. Then what went wrong? "People wanted to get rid of the corrupt Mayawati government. They voted for a party they thought was strong enough to defeat BSP," Gadkari explained at a press conference. A senior party leader was more realistic. "We had Manohar Parrikar in Goa, Parkash Singh Badal in Punjab and B.C. Khanduri in Uttarakhand. We had nobody in Uttar Pradesh," he rued. Even Khanduri was brought in too late, barely six months before the elecNITIN GADKARI (SECOND FROM LEFT) AND OTHER BJP LEADERS AT A PRESS CONFERENCE ON MARCH 6

tions, after a bitter leadership struggle. The infighting in Uttarakhand BJP denied the party a victory in the state. However, the party got it right in Goa, where the presence of a local leader made all the difference. Goa voted for the clean image of Manohar Parrikar, 56. Even the Catholics, who form 28 per cent of Goa's population, played a major role in the BJP's win as the party managed to get 9 per cent votes of the community. BJP fielded five Catholics and all of them won. "Catholics did not have enough representation in BJP earlier. This time we convinced them to stand by us to defeat the corrupt Congress. Our argument that Parrikar's four-and-a-half year regime (between 2000 and 2005) was the best period for Catholics worked in our favour," BJP strategist Sanjeev Desai told INDIA TODAY. A metallurgical engineer from IIT-Mumbai, Parrikar is known for his simple lifestyle and straight talk. He lost out in the race for BJP's presidentship in 2009 after his controversial comment on party leader L.K. Advani, comparing him to "rancid pickle". The party may have forgiven him the comment but what he said is still an issue that BJP has failed to resolve. Advani, despite being rejected by the voters twice in 2004 and 2009, still remains a contender for the party's prime ministerial candidate. The absence of a unifying national leader is bound to affect the party's chances adversely in 2014. The 2012 polls failed to throw up a credible leader that the party could project as their prime ministerial candidate. The names of the same leaders, inimical to one another, keep cropping up--Modi, Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Rajnath Singh and Gadkari himself. It does not seem likely that the party will agree to any one name, probably leaving it to the RSS to thrust another leader upon them.

Uttar Pradesh has again voted decisively in favour of a single party. In 2007, it was Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) which got a majority with 206 seats. This time the voters did not want the BSP. They also did not want a hung Assembly with various parties bargaining for post-poll berths. So they voted for a party they thought could deliver. Punjab bucked the trend of anti-incumbency for the first time since 1967. The people assertively ensured the return of SAD-BJP government. The combine got 68 of the total 117 seats. Goa is also a classic example of a state that is known for its fractured mandates. However, this time the voters did not want an unstable government run on the whims and fancies of corrupt ministers. The issue of illegal mining, taken up vociferously by BJP leader Manohar Parrikar, became the rallying point for the strong antiCongress sentiment. They voted the BJP in with 21 seats in a 40-seat Assembly. In 2007, BJP had 14 seats and Congress held 16. Goa voters also broke another myth--that the Catholics are traditionally Congress voters--as they voted for a stable development-oriented government. Manipur too voted for a majority, giving Congress 42 of the 60 seats. If Uttarakhand threw up a split verdict--with Congress 32 seats and BJP 31--it is more because of differences within the BJP. Had the BJP installed B.C. Khanduri as the chief minister earlier than September 2011, and sorted out the internal differences, it could have got a clear majority. The trend of a decisive vote has been seen in other states

too in earlier elections. Voters left no scope for any post-poll permutations and combinations as they brought in Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress and J. Jayalalithaa's AIADMK to power with a clear majority in the 2011 Assembly polls. In 2010, it was the people of Bihar who voted in the Nitish Kumar-led government with BJP winning 91 seats and his party JD(U) getting 115. Maharashtra had sprung a surprise in 2009 as Congress-NCP combine reached the halfway mark with 144 of the 288 seats. The state saw a ruling front with a clear majority in the House for the first time since 1990. Political parties and observers are now waiting for the crucial Assembly elections--Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir and Tripura next year. "No leader or party can take the voters for granted anymore. If they don't want you, they will throw you out forcefully and conclusively. Narendra Modi should take heed. His fate is next. If people do not want him, he will lose with a big margin,'' predicts a BJP leader. The politics of change ensures rich dividends and single-party stability.

"Mid-term polls are likely," said Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj soon after a Congress rout in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab was apparent on March 6. Swaraj, however, ruled out any attempt by BJP to precipitate a fall of the UPA Government. BJP need not do anything. The real threat to the survival of the UPA Government comes from two parties, Trinamool Congress, part of UPA, and Samajwadi Party, which supports UPA from the outside. If both parties were to withdraw support to the UPA, the Government would almost certainly fall. Both parties stand to gain substantially from a Lok Sabha election in 2012. The SP has 23 MPs in the current Lok Sabha. If the Assembly election results were to be mirrored in a General Election--that is usually the case when the two are held in quick succession--SP would almost double its tally to 45 MPs. It would become an even more pivotal player than it already is in the stability of a government at the Centre. With 45 MPs, it could conceivably be at the core of a new front of regional parties. For now, SP insists it is focused on 2014. Says party spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhury, "The party will enforce all the announcements made in the manifesto. This will help in the coming Parliament elections in 2014." The Trinamool Congress has 19 MPs in the current Lok Sabha. If its crushing victory over the Left Front in the May 2011 Assembly elections were to mirror in a General Election, it would win 25 seats, and its alliance partner Congress would win around six. According to one veteran

Trinamool Congress leader, Mamata Banerjee harbours prime ministerial ambitions in the event that neither the Congress nor BJP is in a position to form the next Government. In a 1996-like scenario, she could be a consensus `Gowda' if she has 25-30 seats in her bag. Other parties would also gain from an early election, even if they are not in a position to bring down the incumbent. In Tamil Nadu, Jayalalitha's AIADMK, which routed DMK in the May 2011 Assembly elections, will be looking at victory in at least 25 seats, almost three times the seats it won in 2009. The Shiromani Akali Dal, which won only four seats in 2009, could double its tally based on its Assembly election performance. Other regional parties which are incumbent in state governments but pitted against the Congress, like BJD in Orissa, would also capitalise on the strong anti-Congress feeling at the Centre and win at least as many seats (14) as it did last time. The Janata Dal (United) in Bihar won 20 seats in 2009. With its alliance partner BJP, it cornered 32 seats out of 40. There may be some gains at the expense of RJD and LJP but the Congress is not a player in Bihar. BJP may yet engineer a fall of the UPA Government in 2012. It will certainly be a big gainer from the decline of the Congress. The INDIA TODAY Mood of the Nation Poll in January had predicted that BJP would win 140 seats if a Lok Sabha election were to be held then. The immediate pressure is, however, from within.
