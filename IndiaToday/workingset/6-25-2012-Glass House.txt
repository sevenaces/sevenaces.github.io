SAY NO TO SIBAL
he man who would not take no for an answer now can't hear a yes. First, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) trumped Union Minister Kapil Sibal's suggestion that former Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) chief J.S. Sarma be given a second term. Rahul Khullar got the coveted job. Now, the PMO wants the process of selection of a University Grants Commission (UGC) chairman to be re-started from scratch. Sibal had virtually confirmed IIM-Bangalore director Pankaj Chandra for the post that has been lying vacant for a year.

f you go close to someone whose stature is big, you will find he has a very small heart. On the contrary, a seemingly unimportant person can have a big heart," said BJP chief Nitin Gadkari at Mumbai's Indian Merchants' Chamber Hall on June 11. He was releasing former police officer Y.C. Pawar's autobiography Real Time Cop. Observers were struck by how similar it sounded to the slogan on the pro-Sanjay Joshi posters which sprang up all over Ahmedabad and Delhi last week: "Chhota man hone se koi bada nahi hota".

RAHUL'S ROUT
ven the Congress Working Committee seems to have become sceptical of Rahul Gandhi. At its June 4 meeting, Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda talked about a Kamraj-type plan to make way for a younger generation. He offered his own resignation and added that "Rahulji should play a more central role" . Soon after, former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi proposed that Rahul be given larger responsibility within the party. Instead of the expected clamour of support, there was silence at the table, even though both Rahul and Sonia Gandhi were present. Rahul clearly needs to look up from his BlackBerry and read the graffiti on the wall.

MISSING IN ACTION
nand Sharma is among those who believe power lies in making the masses wait. He arrived four hours late for a Congress rally at Kangra in Himachal Pradesh on June 7. All the other leaders were on the dais at 11.30 a.m., Sharma appeared at 3 p.m. The rally ended half an hour later. A community lunch was scheduled for Congress VIPs to meet with local leaders. But Sharma is too grand for an ordinary lunch. He went off to dine in a private room at a local Club Mahindra resort. Sharma still hopes that these brief interactions with the hoi polloi will be enough to make him chief minister after the polls at the end of the year. Perhaps. Anything is possible in a party where Vijay Bahuguna was made chief minister at the expense of grassroots leader Harish Rawat.

IN A NEW ROLE
hat's the best way for a dynast daughter to make an impression? DMK's Kanimozhi started a cultural organisation. Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule went a step beyond. She launched the Rashtrawadi Yuvati Congress in Mumbai's Shanmukhanand Hall on June 10, the party's 12th foundation day. She is trying

to project herself as another power centre in the party. About time too, since cousin Ajit Pawar seems to have anointed himself as the political heir to Sharad Pawar.

rithviraj Chavan wanted to check how Mumbaikars travel during the monsoon, especially now with key roads dug up by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority for the ongoing eastern freeway, metro railway and mono rail. So he dispensed with his usual mode of transport--a Tata Safari--and travelled through Chembur, Wadala and Ghatkopar on a bus. The question is: How bad is the situation and how much worse will it get during the rains?

hen it comes to interest rates, Finance Minister and prospective President Pranab Mukherjee is out of the decision loop. He has little control over the RBI Governor D. Subbarao, who sets interest rates. Subbarao, who served as finance secretary under Mukherjee's predecessor P. Chidambaram, was appointed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and is a protégé of his economic adviser C. Rangarajan. Subbarao has resisted Mukherjee's suggestions to lower interest rates, choosing instead to listen to the more hawkish advice of Rangarajan.
