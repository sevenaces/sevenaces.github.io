ormer Congressman Natwar Singh had an hour-long meeting with Sonia Gandhi at 10 Janpath recently. According to a source, "They had a very good conversation." The usually loquacious Singh is keeping his cards close to the chest, fuelling speculation of a return to Congress.

here was a flutter among Congressmen when L.K. Advani walked into Rashtrapati Bhavan for the swearing-in of Chief Justice Altamas Kabir on September 29 and found there were no empty seats for him in the front row. This had happened twice before and he had made his displeasure known. Congress Cabinet ministers Ghulam Nabi Azad and V. Narayanasamy jumped to their feet and between them, dragged three chairs for Advani, who remarked, "Now I have a problem of plenty." That's a problem every politician would love to have.

When Jaswant Singh wrote a book on Jinnah, BJP ostracised him. But his new book, The Audacity of Opinion, has his party turning the pages to read an essay on Sex and Public Life. How audacious.

WHY IS THIS MAN SMILING?
GOGOI

SEARCH FOR A SAFE SEAT

ssam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has got ringside tickets to a turf war between two rivals. Assam Forest Minister Rockybul Hussain recently shot off a terse note to one-time friend, Assam Accord Implementation Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. Hussain pulled up Sarma for not taking action against Bangladeshi infiltrators. He also sent a copy to Sonia Gandhi. Hussain was miffed with a series of reports by News Live, a TV channel owned by Sarma's wife, suggesting Hussain had turned a blind eye to encroachers in Kaziranga. Gogoi told the media, "This is one feud I am going to have fun watching."

run Jaitley is said to be scouting for a seat to make his Lok Sabha debut. He has realised that he is the only one of GenNext with prime ministerial ambitions who doesn't have a Lok Sabha win up his sleeve. Even Nitin Gadkari has announced that he will be contesting the next General Elections. One option for Jaitley is New Delhi, as he has a home in the area. However, this seat is currently held by Ajay Maken, and may not be easy to win. Another option is Chandigarh where he has a strong chance of impressing the sizeable Punjabi community. Jaitley could also fight from Lucknow, a smart move, given that it is Atal Bihari Vajpayee's former seat.

MORE CONGRESS THAN BJP
MISHRA

rajesh Mishra's death on September 28 was mourned more by the Congress than BJP. Mishra was national security adviser as well as principal secretary in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government. Manmohan Singh was among the first to condole his death. It took BJP 72 hours to draft an official message. Even the cremation had a stronger UPA presence with Sonia Gandhi, Digvijaya Singh, National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon, and adviser to the PM TKA Nair in attendance. Only a handful of BJP leaders such as Arun Jaitley, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Arun Shourie showed up. L.K. Advani visited Mishra's family at home.

FRIENDLY FIRE
t the Congress Working Committee meeting on September 25, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had to face fire from some colleagues. But what surprised him most was an attack from Cabinet colleague Mukul Wasnik.The usually mild-mannered Wasnik was not upset with the series of economic reforms but he was angry that Manmohan was not doing enough for the welfare sector.Wasnik claimed that unlike UPA 1, the present Government was neglecting the SC/STs.An irate Manmohan retorted that since Wasnik was part of the Government, he should know that it was not a machine to churn out populist schemes. Oh dear.That's not what the National Advisory Council thinks, is it?

Shashi Tharoor will receive the Encomienda de la Real Orden Espanola de Carlos III, Spain's highest civilian award. Isn't he lucky that the reshuffle has been postponed? He is tipped to become a minister.A Cabinet post would make him ineligible for the Spanish honour.

. C. Chacko says he cancelled the October 3 JPC meeting because of BJP's non-cooperation. In reality, it is because he and colleague Manish Tewari have differed over inviting Attorney General (AG) Goolam Vahanvati. Tewari feels getting the AG to depose on the 2G scam would be violating the attorneyclient privilege between him and the Government of India. To which Chacko asks why Tewari wanted former AG Soli Sorabjee to depose. Tewari points out that he was simply asking Sorabjee to clarify a policy matter--whether it was right for the then NDA government to announce a migration package for telecom operators in 1999 at a time when it was a caretaker government.
