GEHLOTSPENTRs 48,000 ADAYON TEAAND SNACKS
TI queries bust the Gandhian aura that Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has built around himself. The self-proclaimed believer of simple living has spent Rs 4.88 crore offering visitors tea, snacks and meals in his first three years in office from April 1, 2009, to January 16, 2012, Rajasthan's Cabinet Secretariat stated on January 31 in response to a query by Jaipur resident Yadunath Dashanan. In contrast, the secretariat data reveals that Vasundhara Raje, former chief minister of the state and royal scion from the house of Scindias, who Gehlot of-

Gehlot calls rival Raje flamboyant. But he beats her hands down in hospitality.

ten accuses of leading a flamboyant life, spent Rs 2.2 crore on guests from 2004 to 2007. Overall, she spent Rs 5.47 crore during her five-year term from 2003 to 2008. Gehlot's favourite gift for special visitors is the Gandhi diary. In three years, he spent Rs 10.35 lakh, including Rs 5.60 lakh in 2011, handing out diaries to officials, visitors and mediapersons to buttress his Gandhian credentials. They carry no information about the state, not even telephone numbers of important government officials. Ironically, the cash-strapped Rajasthan govern-

ment does not publish an official diary or a directory of officials. Raje spent Rs 3.19 lakh on gifts to VIP guests over five years. They include chocolates, paintings, pens, dry fruits, sweets and Ganesha idols, but Raje's favourite gift item was silver photo frames which accounted for one-third of her overall spending. She also gave chocolates worth Rs 385 to a visitor, a Rs 285 pen set to her aircraft pilot and spent Rs 12,430 on a painting, dry fruits and a bouquet of flowers for the then governor. Raje and Gehlot together have also spent at least Rs 4 crore on accommodation, conveyance and security expenditure for former Gujarat and Rajasthan governor, retired high court judge Anshuman Singh, since 2004, reveals the government's response to an RTI query filed by journalist Milap Chand Dandia. Dandia had filed a PIL before Rajasthan High Court to end these privileges but was advised on January 9 to move the authority concerned first. On February 6, he submitted a memorandum to Chief Secretary S. Ahmed to withdraw the facilities. He is yet to get a response. Singh did not respond to calls, but a senior official close to him said: "The government helped Singh because he was living in a humble rented accommodation after demitting Raj Bhavan in 2003." Raje has rarely ever spoken against one's right to lead a good life. In contrast, Gehlot, at a public function in Jaipur in February 2010 waxed eloquent about the need and the importance of austerity: "My heart burns and I detest going to marriages where invitation cards cost Rs 2,000 a piece and meals cost Rs 1,000 a plate." Charity and austerity always begin at home.
