Shahpur Jat:
Rummaging through bargain markets for antique and cheap imitations of current fashion is passé.

Check out Jangi House Lane which is dotted with shops selling embellished garments characterised by bright colours and tailored fits. Touché is perfect for stylish yet understated wear.

Relics of the Raj
Coronation Park: Boys from the neighbourhood play cricket in the grounds. The kachori vendor eyes all prospective customers who would probably come to see this historical site. Coronation Park, in one of the forgotten corners of north Delhi, has a string of memories associated with it-- in 1877, Queen Victoria was proclaimed the Empress of India at this site. In 1903, the coronation of her son Edward VII was celebrated here. On December 11, 1911, King George V declared the transfer of `the seat of the Government of India from Calcutta to the ancient capital of Delhi'. The Coronation Memorial is a sandstone obelisk built on a square plinth; the chief attraction is in a side enclosure, west of the obelisk. The crescent shaped garden also has abandoned statues of British nobility and the centre piece is the 60 feet tall figure of King George V.

Fiery treat
Andhra Bhavan: The best advice we can give you is to go early--reach a few minutes after 1:00 pm and the queues outside Andhra Bhavan canteen will already be madding. But the obsequious manager does a good job at handling the never-ending hungry crowd. A no-frills place with a basic set up-- sometimes you may have to share a table, at other times you might have to dodge elbows jostling for space--but the food is truly worth it . The thali here is legendary, with feather-light unlimited puris, glistening rice, yellow dal, sambar, rasam, fried cabbage, brinjal or kesar bhath prepared in desi ghee. What adds to the taste are the accompaniments--`gunpowder', gongura pickle and ghee. Try their mutton fry or dry chicken that taste best with a dash of lemon. Remember, lingering over your meal is not encouraged. You're expected to eat and leave, make room for the next batch of hungry lunchers.

Akshardham Temple: A
desi Disneyland might be a fair comparison, with the temple playing host to a musical fountain, exhibition halls, a large-format movie screen and boat rides, among other attractions.

It has nine domes, 20 pinnacles, 234 pillars and over 20,000 sculptured figures. There is also a food court and a souvenir shop.

It has five distinct storeys: the first three storeys are made of red sandstone; the fourth and fifth storeys are of marble and sandstone. At the foot of the tower is the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, one of earliest mosques to be built in India. A seven metre high iron pillar stands in the courtyard of the mosque.

Blast from the past
INTACH heritage walks:
Feroz Shah Tughlaq was known more for his preservation work rather than building new monuments and where Lodhi gardens is right now was once the village of Khairpur. These are only a few of the facts that you can pick up in the heritage walk exploring the monuments inside Lodi Gardens, organised by INTACH's (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage) Delhi chapter. Braving the Delhi winter morning is worth it, with the walk being an insight into the past. For the uninitiated, this is probably the best way to get to know the palimpsests of layers that the city encompasses. The walks last two hours and are carried out in a relaxed pace with ample time to marvel at the monuments and take photographs. Bookings for the walk are done on their website and walks are postponed if less than seven people register, so it is advisable to go as a group. Price: Rs 50 per person Where: Five locations across the city.

India Gate: Tourists posing for a picture are a common sight here at India Gate. People from different parts of the country or groups of school children on a `Delhi darshan' tour, all seem totally smitten by this 42 metre high building in the centre of New Delhi. The significance of the structure is not known to many though, which is that India Gate commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during World War I. The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it was designed by Edwin Lutyens. The sprawling garden surrounding the structure draws tourists and locals alike. Ice cream vendors, bhelpuri vendors, balloon wallahs and photographers do brisk business. On a sunny winter afternoon, you can spot families spreading sheets and sitting on the grass even as their children play around, sometimes, coming in the way of the young couples, who are usually to be found hidden behind the trees. Go, be part of the scene.

Follow this up with the Shahjahani murgh and Jahangiri qorma. The roghani naan, which usually runs out quite early on in the evening, makes for the ideal accompaniment to these curries. The tandoori raan (hind leg of lamb) is a musthave. But should you care to up the ante a bit, preorder the Tandoori Bakra, an entire lamb, stuffed with rice, chicken, eggs, dry fruit and spices.

A walk through this sleepy Tibetan refugee colony is peppered with sights of elderly folk playing a game of carom, grannies sitting on corner benches and knitting, and children playing outside the monastery. Further down this lane is the Tibetan market where the shops lined up one after another sell T-shirts, woollen jackets, trekking gear, brass and silver jewellery. The colony has been there since 1960 and is home to three generations of Tibetan refugees. The highlight of a visit to this camp is the food-- from momos and thukpa to thenthuk, nothing should be missed. The most popular haunt for food lovers is Dolma House. Popular with the locals who often pop in to grab a bite, one also sees students from Delhi University flocking here to taste their fried momos. At: Right bank of the River Yamuna on the G. T.

Agrasen ki Baoli: Among the high-rise buildings of Connaught
Place lies Agrasen Ki Baoli, an ancient stepwell. It is said that the baoli was built by King Agrasen during the Mahabharata era, and was rebuilt by the Agarwal community in the 14th century. The site is characterised by a beautifully crafted staircase of 103 steps that lead to what was once a flourishing well. Today, the landmark is home to hundreds of bats and pigeons. Unlike the traditional circular-shaped well, this one has a raised platform with a roof on the northern end. This 60-metere long and 15-metre wide stepwell is protected by Archaeological Survey of India. Though not as popular as its counterparts in Gujarat and Rajasthan, this stepwell is one of the few in Delhi and its neighbouring areas. At: Hailey Road, Near KG Marg, Rajiv Chowk, Barakhamba Road

National Gallery of Modern Art: Located at Jaipur House, this building was originally designed by Sir Arthur Bloomfield as a residence for the Maharaja of Jaipur. It was later converted into a museum (1954) and has been successful in displaying the dynamism and energy of artists from various regions across the country. Art works created after 1857 have been preserved within the galleries. Some of the works on display include paintings by Amrita Sher Gill and M F Hussain.
