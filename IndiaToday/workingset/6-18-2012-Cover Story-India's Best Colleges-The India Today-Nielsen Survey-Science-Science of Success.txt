SCIENCE
ACTIVE FORMULA
 From physics to chemistry, every department at St. Stephen's has its own active student society.  The college facilitates over 150 annual summer internship projects for students. classes, Stephen's boasts of 100 per cent faculty attendance rate. My colleagues have given their lives to their field of study. Faculty members are always available outside classrooms and work closely as understanding mentors to every student," emphasises Valson Thampu, the college principal. The `sciencees' at Stephen's currently boast of a survival rate of over 50 per cent, the highest in India. In other words, over 50 per cent students from a given batch and field of study graduate to pursue science as a long-term career option. "In the field of science that is a phenomenal number. Our department has produced some remarkable scientists and inventors. For example, Nitya Anand, batch of 1945, discovered centchroman, a contraceptive also known as Saheli, and went on to become the director of the Central Drug Research Institute," says S.V. Eswaran, 60, dean of academics and head of the department of chemistry. A unique feature of Stephen's, one that justifies the college's top position in science, is the dedication to scientific research that has played out over the past year on campus. The college has facilitated over 150 summer research projects for students at prestigious institutions such as Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore, and Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore. "These are not mere CV-building exercises but exposure to real scientific study. Last year, one of our students, Samyak Mittal, co-authored a research paper with scientists of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata, which was published in the 2012 issue of Angewandte Chemie International Edition English. This is no mean achievement nor is it a oneoff example. We are the only college in India to promote serious research work even at the under-graduate level," continues Eswaran, who has been teaching chemistry at Stephen's for the past 40 years. The emphasis on scientific research initiated by DU in 2011 has benefited the college. Seven of the 118 research projects that DU commissioned for Rs 10 lakh each for the academic year 2012-13 have been granted to St. Stephen's. St. Xavier's College, Mumbai, has pulled off a near-Houdini act with its second place rank in science after being placed 18th in 2011. Rajendra Shinde, 45, vice-principal (science), St. Xavier's, attributes the progress partially to the autonomy granted by University of Mumbai to the college's

HISTORY
St. Stephen's College was founded on February 1, 1881, by the Cambridge Mission to Delhi in conjunction with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. In the early years, the college occupied rented premises in two old Mughal-style mansions in the bylanes of Chandni Chowk. On October 1, 1941, the college occupied its present premises in Delhi University Enclave.

am Seshadri is the best student I have received in my life, send more like him from St. Stephen's. So said CNR Rao, 77, head of the Scientific Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India, to Stephanians during a lecture in March 2011 in the college as part of its celebrations for the International Year of Chemistry. Seshadri, 38, who completed his BSc in chemistry from St. Stephen's in 1989, is now professor of biochemistry at the University of

R

California. Built upon two old tennis courts, the science department at St. Stephen's has been producing eminent scientists like Seshadri for the past 130 years. Topping the INDIA TODAY-Nielsen survey of the best science colleges in India, the department has come a long way since its humble beginnings. Funding was meagre during the first few years and it was only when Deepak Pental served as the Delhi University (DU) vice-chancellor between 2005 and 2010 that the department was given its first major grant of

Rs 2.5 crore. The results of the grant are clearly visible today in the four modular science labs that were refurbished in 2011, high-speed wi-fi connectivity on campus, over 40 annual faculty research projects and faculty visits from eminent institutions like University of Cambridge, Brown University, Max Planck Laboratory and Ohio University. "There is one thing about St. Stephen's that no other college can ever beat. In a university where statistics have shown that over 30 per cent teachers do not turn up for

science department. Traditionally, the university would recruit students based on Class XII marks and distribute them to various departments across colleges under the university. However, in 2011-12, St. Xavier's not only admitted students on its own but worked on drafting its own syllabus in various disciplines. "We have spent considerable time and resources upgrading our science department. The University Grants Commission and Department of Science & Technology have granted us funds to enhance our quality of fac-

ulty, research work and equipment facilities. We have also started publishing our own research journal, Xplore, a unique peer review scientific journal that is the first of its kind in Indian academia," says Shinde. Science students at St. Xavier's can avail a wide range of disciplines, excellent laboratories and renowned research centres like the Blatter Herbarium, the Caius Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Research and the Nadkarny-Sacasa Chemistry Research Laboratory. Another fresh entry to the top five this year is Presidency College, Kolkata. Established in 1817, the college has long held a reputation for academic excellence in the fields of chemistry, geology, biosciences and physics. "In the past year, Presidency has made two significant developments in science. We have hired some outstanding academicians such as Somak Raychaudhari from the University of Birmingham. Secondly, our Cluster Innovation Centre for pilot research projects has been identified by the Prime Minister's Office as the first of its kind in India. These initiatives have really enhanced the quality of academic input," says Malabika Sarkar, vice-chancellor, Presidency College, Kolkata. But when it comes to being number one, no college surpasses the standard of student life, infrastructure, initiatives and facilities available at St. Stephen's. "The college faculty has always inspired me throughout. I love the practical exposure for students in and outside campus," says Chandrima Majumdar, final year BSc Chemistry (Hons) student. Having published an academic paper on `Applied Organometallic Chemistry' while researching at IIT-Madras, at age 20, Majumdar's feat is a testament to the nurturing and progressive environment at St. Stephen's.
