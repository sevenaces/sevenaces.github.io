Rahman concerts and come July, she will be seen jamming with musician Amit Trivedi during the second season of Coke Studio on MTV. She has sung a Marathi song in English Vinglish, a Gujarati one for composer Rushi Vakil's album and has a new single--a fusion of Justin Bieber's Baby and Dum Maaro Dum's Te Amo.
