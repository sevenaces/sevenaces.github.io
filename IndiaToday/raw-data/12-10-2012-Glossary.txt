NEW BEST FRIENDS FOREVER
Maybe everybody got tired of waiting for Nargis Fakhri to announce her next film and wanted something new to talk about. But openly flirting with Uday Chopra on Twitter isn't going to make those rumours of a brewing romance go away. When a tweet made her laugh he commented,"I'm glad I made you laugh... as they say `Ladki hassi toh phassi' ." She returned with,"yes making a girl laugh is the key! We all love funny guys." They are often seen together but are sticking with `good friends.' How creative.

HELLO TINSEL TOWN
With sports buffs concluding that her career in the game is over, Sania Mirza raised many eyebrows when she turned up for the 10K Run in Hyderabad on November 25. "Your attire is appropriate, but OMG, do you really need pancake make-up and such huge rocks on your ears and finger early in the morning? And look at those huge frames and cheek blush," said a comment widely circulated on social media. Mirza may have to rethink her plans to start a tennis academy.

seemed to be doing all right. She was the popular Ragini from Sapna Babul Ki Bidaai and had a stint in Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 3. Then she picked a film called Myoho for her debut. She plays two roles--a simple village girl who is later reincarnated as a glamorous, modern girl. Yawn. That eager for the big screen?

STRINGS ATTACHED
