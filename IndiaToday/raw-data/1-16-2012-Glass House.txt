GLASS HOUSE
HAND IT TO HIM

by KAVEREE BAMZAI

n New Year's Day, Delhi readers of a popular national newspaper were greeted by a giant picture of a smiling AICC President Sonia Gandhi on the front page. However, this advertisement was not paid for by the INC, but by perhaps Gandhi's biggest fan. "We remain, Madamji, ever at your feet," was the message from Congress party worker, H. Vasanthakumar, 62, who wanted to wish his leader in style. The former Tamil Nadu MLA and founder of Vasanth & Co, a consumer electronics store worth Rs 550 crore, has even launched a Tamil TV channel for the party, modestly named after himself. He is not new to the praise game. In one December 2004 ad wishing Gandhi a happy birthday, he suggested that she was a "TOP STAR of Asia" and that she alone spoke "for all Indians" .

hile his father P. Chidambaram handled the Government's double fault on the Lokpal Bill, son Karti P. Chidambaram was trying to serve an ace, promoting the Chennai Open tennis tournament. Apart from making appearances at events leading up to the annual tournament, the Congress party member has been tweeting actively. The vice-president of the All India Tennis Association and chairman of the organising committee of the tournament tweeted about various players, including crowd favourite Mahesh Bhupathi, and congratulated Indian wild card entrant Yuki Bhambri on his win. Is that enough to qualify him as a sport?

GEHLOT

TRUST DEFICIT
Assembly elections in Rajasthan are due next year and even Ashok Gehlot's own man doesn't hold out much hope for him. Pradesh Congress President Chander Bhan on December 29 told members of the District Congress Committee in Jodhpur that Congress would be able to get only 70 to 80 seats if elections were to be held now. His statement came 16 days after Gehlot had patted his own back. In Jaipur, Gehlot on completion of three years in power had said: "My performance this time is better than my previous tenure when we were reduced from 156 seats to 56 in 2003." Congress won 96 seats in 2008, still short of the simple majority of 101.

hief Economic Adviser Kaushik Basu, who was due to retire at the end of January after turning 60, has been granted a generous six-month extension. It's timed perfectly with the beginning of a new academic year in the US. Basu, who narrowly missed the bus to become RBI governor last September, will return to the classroom at America's Cornell University in September. The academic in Basu is already coming to the fore. In an interview to a TV channel on January 2, he went where no bureaucrat goes by saying in public that politics may trump economics in 2012.

METRO TROUBLE

THE NANO EFFECT
lying to Ahmedabad? Confirmed tickets are not enough. You need a go-ahead from Didi. The moment Mamata Banerjee came to know that a five-day trip of the standing committee of industry and commerce of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly included a visit to the Nano factory in Sanand, she said no. Forward Bloc MLA Paresh Adhikari is chairman of the nine-member committee, and Didi sniffed a "political conspiracy" in the inclusion of Sanand in the itinerary. The MLAs, who were about to board a flight to Ahmedabad on January 2, went home from the Assembly with packed travel bags. BANERJEE

Sreedharan's retirement from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has altered plans for Kerala. The United Democratic Front government has told Sreedharan that the state will invite a global tender for the Rs 5,000-crore Kochi Metro Rail project. The previous Left Democratic Front government had promised the contract to DMRC. But now Excise and Infrastructure Minister K. Babu says, "Why should we run after DMRC from which Sreedharan has retired? In any case, we have to go by the global tender as stipulated by the Japanese agency which funds the project." An angry Sreedharan has ordered the DMRC's Kerala office to shut down.
