HAIR RAISING
With so many celebrities wanting to experiment with their looks and hair to suit different roles, hair-spotting has never been so much fun

Sanjay Dutt seems to
be in the mood for extreme makeovers. He began the year with a clean pate when he shaved his head to play Kancha Cheena in Agneepath, and ended up looking sinister, in a way we didn't think was possible. It's quite the opposite, however, for Son Of Sardaar, where he dons long, flowing hair. The new look may not be quite as horrifying as the bald one, but one toss of that mane ought to send many people scurrying.

Mandira Bedi revamped her patent short hairdo by trimming her tresses further for a pixie look. She went for the makeover soon after doing an ad campaign for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and for fashion label SoFake. The advertisement promoting faux leather has her in an edgy spiked jacket and puffed hair. Now, her locks have been snipped to a bare minimum, giving her a look that is currently the rage in Hollywood.

Fashion designer Pria Kataria Puri must have been looking at wax statues and old stylebooks for inspiration, when she was deciding on what to wear for a party at Tote On The Turf in Mumbai. Otherwise, she would have known that semi-blonde, multi-coloured tresses and plastic faces went out years ago. Could she have been practising how best to resemble a mannequin, now that she has been named brand ambassador for Cappuccino Jewellery collection?

ZINTA

BACK IN ACTION
Preity Zinta, 37, has finally managed to tear herself away from the cricket grounds. Now, she shuttles between Paris for her first production Ishkq In Paris, and Varanasi for Neeraj Pathak's Bhaiyyaji Superhit, where she plays Sunny Deol's aggressive wife and a gangster's daughter. The two contrasting worlds may be difficult to pull off, but how else would we know if she's back in the game.

MOTHER TO DIRECTOR
Ratna Pathak Shah, 49, has been busy playing mother in Bollywood for a long time. But now, she will be seen in a brand new avatar. Shah has directed her debut play A Walk in the Woods, adapted from Lee Blessing's Pulitzernominated play of the same name. Her husband Naseeruddin Shah and actor Rajit Kapur will be seen in the 120-minute play, set in Switzerland.

EXCLUSIVELY YOURS

D'SOUZA

Genelia D'Souza, 24, has her eyes only for husband Riteish Deshmukh. The two refuse to be separated, even on celluloid. Her first outing on the big screen after the wedding is with him, for an untitled film directed by Saket Chaudhary. Not to forget Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya and Tujhe Meri Kasam. We may have to endure Deshmukh at all her sightings. How boring.
