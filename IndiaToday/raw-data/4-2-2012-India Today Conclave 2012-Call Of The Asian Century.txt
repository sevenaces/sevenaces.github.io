he tables are turned. The old world has squandered its advantages and the new world is ready to step in. The mood is upbeat. The ground reality is teeming with opportunities. With the American economy still stuttering and the Eurozone in deep distress, the centre of gravity of global power and influence is shifting eastward. Hope is not a plan, nor a foreign policy. It's a choice that confronts the East. Celebrate, ideate, debate the Asian Century. At the 11th Conclave of the India Today Group, An Asian Century: Securing the Global Promise, a formidable galaxy of minds gazed at the crystal ball of Asia's future. For two days, March 16-17, leaders from all

spheres converged in Delhi to analyse the idea of the Asian Century, its power and potential, challenges and choices, vulnerability and vitality. Will Asia conquer the world? Will India find its place in the new world map? The clock strikes 9.45 a.m. It's Friday, March 16. Chandeliers dim. The LED wall on the stage blinks to life. Giant video screens, spooling quotes and tweets, light up. A hush falls on the audience. This is the hour when every year, for the last 10 years, Editor-in-Chief of the India Today Group, Aroon Purie, welcomes leaders of government, business and society to take part in the country's largest think-fest. "It is wonderful to see veterans of the conclave. We are now old enough to have veterans. We have tried to make the conclave an arena for the curious mind. And we must be doing something right, that you keep coming back." The off-the-cuff humour set the tone of the

Analysing the Asian miracle and India's role in it was an exciting mix of eclectic minds, ranging from statesmen to social activists, ministers to movie stars, scientists to sports stars, authors to ambassadors, business leaders to spiritual leaders, techies to yogis. Opinions and comments flew thick and fast. Sharp questions and playful banter were exchanged. A thousand-strong audience tried to keep up with the war of words as 45 speakers told the story of a new world order in 48 hours. Conclave 2012 had it all. From a mass mobiliser naming his wannabe assassin to an author walking a tightrope between freedom of speech and freedom to offend; from a Bollywood leading lady calling for more zeros in her pay cheque to a sacked railway minister hinting at the whims of his leader; from a US statesman's unexpected confessions to cricket stars on a soul-searching quest; from Asia's privileged GenerationNext questioning their inheritance to

VIRENDER SEHWAG didn't understand why Imran Khan skipped the conclave."Who is Salman Rushdie? Is he the president of some country?" he asked. When explained, he said: "You don't have to support a person if you sit next to him. I don't understand such politics."

top officials of political parties talking about truce behind the scenes; from Internet czars battling for social media supremacy to a yogi quantifying Indian black money stashed overseas; from a future leader of Malaysia to a current leader of America. In its scope, this year's theme was a logical extension of Conclave 2011-- The Changing Balance of Power. Ten

years ago, the three largest economies, the US, European Union (EU) and Japan accounted for two-thirds of the global economy. Now, it is only half. By 2030, India and China alone are expected to contribute as much to the global economy as the US and the EU combined. For the first time, Asia-Pacific has more billionaires than Europe. But economy no longer determines the

hierarchy of global power. "New forces are hard at play," Purie had pointed out at the 2011 conclave. "Any nation that claims a stake for future generations must strike a balance between the demands of development and the power of technology and the well-being of the earth." Joining the dots this year, Purie asserted in his opening speech, "I have

great faith in the dynamism and energy of Indian enterprise. I doubt whether that faith is matched by the practice of our ruling political class." Short-term political compromises that hinder badly needed reforms have become a way of life for the nation, he said, sacrificing the prospect of longterm sustainable growth at the altar of an electoral strategy dominated by re-

ligion, community and caste. "Political parties in India are completely out of touch with the needs, aspirations and hopes of the Indian people," he added. M.J. Akbar, editorial director, INDIA TODAY, added a new dimension to the list of vulnerabilities that faces the Asian Century. There is war, peace and the large space in between, "sometimes called the fog of war", he said. In

ith the American economy still stuttering and the Eurozone in deep crisis, the focus of the world has shifted to Asia. Here at least there is, in varying degrees, growth and the prospect of more growth. More importantly, there is hope--a commodity in short supply in many parts of the world. I have great faith in the dynamism and energy of Indian enterprise. I believe that the world too has faith in the possibilities of the Indian market, and the potential of India as an economic power of tomorrow. I doubt whether that faith is matched by the practice of our ruling political class. But there is hope that Indian politics is changing. Bad politics is getting a resounding No from a people let down by the elected. Last week's legislative Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and some other states were a fine tribute to the robustness of Indian democracy--

and a slap on the face for those who took it for granted. The past one year in the life of Indian democracy has been traumatic. Scam and scandal became synonymous with those in power. India was on the verge of abandoning hope. It badly needed a redeemer, a moral cleanser. It happened in the shape of a diminutive Gandhian called Anna Hazare. He was the Citizen Rearmed who shook India. The Satyagrahi became the moral rejoinder to the political rot. As he went on fasting for a clean India, he put the power of hunger against the hunger for power. The difference between India and China is that an Anna Hazare could not have happened there. There is indeed much to be admired about the Chinese model. Before the end of this decade, by an IMF estimate, China will become the world's largest economy. Still, China evokes as much admiration as fear. It inspires as well

as intimidates. It doesn't extend the freedom of the marketplace into the mind of the citizen. China's bigger struggle is within, and this struggle influences its uneasy relationship with the rest of the world. The desire for democratic freedom is one of the greatest forces in the world. One of our speakers, Pakistani politician Imran Khan, regretfully has withdrawn from the conclave because of the participation of the renowned author, Sir Salman Rushdie. We wish that Imran had used this opportunity to express his views here with all the force and lucidity he possesses. We can all agree to disagree but we must present our argument. That is the essence of the India Today Conclave. It is the essence of an open democratic society like ours. We can hold our heads up high all over the world because of this. We should not let self-serving politicians undermine these freedoms.

his word, freedom. It's a beautiful sounding word, isn't it? Who would be against freedom? It's a word everyone would automatically be `for', one would think. A free society is one in which a thousand flowers bloom, in which a thousand and one voices speak. And what a simple and grand idea that seems. It's like that copper goddess standing in the harbour, enlightening the world. But in our time, many essential freedoms are in danger of defeat and not only in totalitarian or authoritarian states. Here in India also, a combination of religious fanaticism, political opportunism and, I have to say, public apathy is damaging that freedom upon which all other freedoms depend: the freedom of expression. Behind these ideas of `offendedness' and `respect' there is always the threat of violence.

Because of this, there is a rise in corruption in the country and society. For transformation, development is just as important as stopping corruption.

It is neither being fought in uniform, nor in Europe, as it was during the first three wars. Asia is the battlefield of the fourth war. "All you have to do is start a war with Iran and there will be a contiguous war from Nile to the Ganga."

Moreover, Asia is not simply a symbol of economic success. It is developing into the world's "nuclear crescent"-- from Israel, Iran, Pakistan, India, China, North Korea to Russia. "If that is not a recipe for conflict or disaster, I don't know what is," Akbar said. While a hundred ideas vied in raucous combat as usual, Conclave 2012 was anchored by two themes: China, or what Purie called "India's China complex". The second was freedom of

discussion, opinion, speech, expression, thought and action, summed up by author Salman Rushdie in his speech: "We are essentially language animals and are nothing without it." Imran Khan chose to withdraw because of Rushdie's presence, but Purie underlined the conclave's stand on it. He said Khan should have used the opportunity to express his views. Purie said, "We can all agree to disagree but we must present our argument." He

officers to quit their positions. But will corruption come to an end with the removal of one corrupt minister? Another of his ilk is waiting to take his place. We have to change the system. To be in this fight against corruption, one should have purity in acts and thoughts, be ready to brave insults and sacrifice life. We should develop these characteristics. The Right to Information can get you information, but it cannot send corrupt people to jail. Jan Lokpal has that power. If Jan Lokpal Bill is implemented, more than half of the politicians across various parties will be in jail. If Jan Lokpal Bill would have been implemented, P. Chidambaram would have been in jail. That's why they don't want it. Either Jan Lokpal will come, or I will sacrifice my life. There are no two ways about that.

Always, the threat is that if you do anything that disrespects or offends me, I will be violent towards you. So the real subject is not religion, it's violence and how we should face up to the threat of violence. The subject is not disagreement. The subject is violence, and the threat of it, which prevents dissenting voices from speaking. That's what is going on and people here are asleep, I think. Very largely asleep to what's going on and you need to wake up.

The threat is if you do anything that disrespects or offends me, I will be violent towards you. So the real subject is not religion, it's violence.

There is a line in my novel Shalimar the Clown in which one character says to another, "Freedom is not a tea party, India. Freedom is a war." You keep the freedoms that you fight for; you lose the freedoms that you neglect. Freedom is something that somebody's always trying to take away from you. And if you don't defend it, you will lose it. The human being, let's remember, is essentially a language animal. We are a creature which has always used language to express our most profound feelings and we are nothing without our language. The attempt to silence our tongue is not only censorship. It's also an existential crime about the kind of species that we are. We are a species which requires to speak, and we must not be silenced. Language itself is a liberty and please, do not let the battle for this liberty be lost.

added, "We do not endorse the beliefs of the speakers but strongly believe in freedom of speech and expression. Rushdie is a storyteller, a man of words and of ideas but not a terrorist. Although the world has moved on, it looks like our subcontinent has not." Symbolising the passion for freedom was Anna Hazare. As Purie pointed out, "The difference between India and China is that an Anna Hazare could not have happened there." A

"If there is no governance, there will be cynicism"
ANWAR BIN IBRAHIM
LEADER OF OPPOSITION AND FORMER DEPUTY PM, MALAYSIA don't need to convince Indians about the virtues of democracy but I need to caution fellow democrats about the despotism and tyranny of the majority, about the expectations from India in this region. Our concern is to ensure that the clamour for reform and democracy remains thorough and meaningful. You have a free media and I know leaders, political leaders, do not necessarily like the notion of free media but this is a rule where I think the Indian leadership has failed. Effective measures to combat corruption remain central because the failure of good governance, of transparency, accountability means growing cynicism towards democratic rule. In Malaysia, anytime you talk about democracy, they say you are an American stooge, if you talk about freedom it becomes essentially a Jewish conspiracy. There is no opportunity whatsoever to counter and place reason because of the lack of, or absence of, a free media. But I remain an optimist even in the worst of times.

It did not take Hazare long to give the conclave its first headline. He announced a nationwide tour within the next two months and said, "Either Jan Lokpal will come, or I will sacrifice my life. There are no two ways about that." The idea of the Asian Century took on multiple meanings. But China appeared like a reference point in multiple sessions. Kissinger, Nobel laureate, the first official American emissary to Communist China and responsible for opening up a dialogue between Washington and Beijing, expressed his

faith in the "balance of Asia", with close ties between China and America, as also between India and America. "China and the US have different approaches to the problem of international affairs," he said. "Americans think every problem has a solution, the Chinese believe that there is no ultimate solution to any problem. Americans have grown up with the concept of sovereignty. The Chinese

have never known it." If Kissinger's visit to China in 1972 prepared the ground for the country "to enter the world", in 2012 it finally arrived "on the world stage", said Jon Huntsman Jr. The former governor of Utah, US, is noted most for bringing China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 as an ambassador.

biggest challenge to the Asian Century is China's ongoing struggle to cope with the role of a world leader.

I would affirm the importance of a Chinese-American relationship but also the importance of an Indian-American relationship, each suited to the circumstances. The key challenge of foreign policy is that when you have the greatest scope for action, your knowledge of consequences is most limited and when you know the consequences, you no longer have scope for action. The art of foreign policy is to have a vision of the future and the courage to pursue it. I believe we are at such a moment in history.

with low-priced imports from a lowcost country like China. It keeps prices of key industrial inputs low for domestic manufacturers, and high for foreign manufacturers. Should India follow that model? The `Chinese model' was also called into question by Anwar bin Ibrahim, Leader of Opposition and former deputy prime minister of Malaysia. "The debate whether to choose between the Indian model or the Chinese model is due to failure of democratic values. Given half a chance, people will choose democracy with whatever limitations," he said. China may have done remarkably well in terms of economic reform but in political reforms, India is still the country that Asians must look up to, he explained. The road towards the Asian Century is strewn with daunting policy, institutional and governance challenges. Where is India headed in these areas? It would not be possible without gender equity, said Bollywood's leading lady Kareena Kapoor. The Indian film industry may have come a long way from slot-

ting women either as glamour dolls or as downtrodden women, but the heroine is still not on a par with the hero when it comes to her economic status. Kapoor was thrilled with the new wave of films centred around the heroine. "It's no fun standing behind Shah Rukh Khan and saying, `Hey, I'm also here'. I hope directors write more roles and I get to choose," she said. In the sports session, ace cricketers Harbhajan Singh and Virender Sehwag dismissed recent match-fixing allegations made by a London-based daily, saying they were confident no Indian cricketer would ever think of getting into that messy turf. The road ahead for them was inclusion of young players. "There is a need to push them in the national selection but it would be difficult to find replacements for the troika of Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag overnight," said Singh. Nasser Hussain, former England captain, was at his witty best. He compared Indian players to biryani. "Indian cricketers are like how my mom used

Now there is a therapy of taking your own stem cells and putting them in the heart and rejuvenating the heart. I am working with a company where we are growing new lungs using stem cells. The area of health and medicine will now progress at an exponential rate. These technologies will be thousand times more powerful than they are today in the next 10 years and million times more powerful in 20 years.

Capitalism needs to have a compassionate face, was the talking point for Kapil Sibal, Union minister for HRD and IT and communications, and Vince Cable, UK secretary of state for business, innovation and skills. In the wake of the collapse of the American banking system and the crisis in Europe, the question assumed added relevance. Both began with references to Adam Smith's book, The Wealth of Nations. Sibal even quoted from his own poem for the occasion. "This laissez faire has come apart/ The end is here rebuild and start/ Late Adam Smith cannot provide/ A recipe to turn the tide." There was a surprise in store at the conclave. Controversial former Union railway minister Dinesh Trivedi, who presented the first growth-oriented Budget for the Railways in nine years, walked in to thunderous applause. Speaking about the railway budget he presented on March 14 that forced him to quit, Trivedi talked about populist politics derailing the development agenda. "If Railways is not the growth engine, India will not grow. Railways is not someone's property. If the Railways is healthy, I guarantee you even Warren Buffet will invest in it," he said.

In my own fraternity, the line between art cinema and commercial cinema has ceased to exist. Films like Paan Singh Tomar get a release and recognition on a par with mainstream films. Even in the case of actresses, we have evolved from being slotted as glamorous dolls decorating the hero's shoulders or long suffering, downtrodden women. I am a case in point.

For Rajan Anandan, country head of Google, consumer is the ultimate king, the reason why e-commerce in India hit the $6 billion mark in 2011. "Today, people are increasingly drawn to the Web to live out their dreams and fantasies; the Web has become the one-stop shop for

all needs," Anandan said. He hit the nail on the head when he summed it up thus: "The relevant question today is no longer one about who will win the Web.

For yoga guru Baba Ramdev, who has built an enormous empire of money, power, influence and controversies in a decade, the right path is to stop multi-

I think it's largely to do with the society and the culture we live in. According to me, for a heroine to be on a par with a hero at the box office, every woman on the street in our country will have to be equal to every man on the street, in every possible way. I know I am talking about Utopia here and an ideal situation is hard to achieve. But if our films at the box office today are any indication, I think we are on the right path.

When I hear the projected figures by trade experts for my new film Heroine, I feel hopeful. And what else are movies about--if not joy, dreams and hope?

It's no fun standing behind Shah Rukh Khan and saying `Hey, I'm also there!' My dream is to see us get the salary that male actors get.

January. It was a skill he displayed to blistering effect against a range of public personalities who had opted out of the conclave because of him, chiefly Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan. He reminded the audience about Khan's London "playboy days" when he was allegedly referred to as "Im the Dim". He argued that Khan was trying to present himself as

the acceptable face of Pakistan by placating the mullahs, talked about "the physical resemblance between Imran and Gaddafi", and talked about the "immeasurable hurt" caused to Muslims by LeT terrorists and the clandestine refuge offered to Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Rushdie also took swipes at writer Chetan Bhagat, who was in the audience and had allegedly taken a stand

against Rushdie at Jaipur, and even at Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi. He concluded by saying that India deserved to be led better than it was. "All of us have the ability to speak our minds," said Rushdie. The conclave, however, is not only for elite thought leaders or even for serious students of politics, economy and business.

Making a rare public appearance, Bangladesh's Sajeeb Wazed, special adviser to the Awami League and son of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, traced his entry into politics by citing the chaos in his country after the 2001 elections. It compelled him to return from the US to draw attention to the wave of atrocities being perpetuated by the Opposition, the Bangladesh National Party. And then it was time for Salman Rushdie, a writer who revels in the plurality of the subcontinent, said Aatish Taseer, the British-born writerjournalist who moderated the concluding session. No one, he pointed out, has let Rushdie down as much as the subcontinent. "Cambridge teaches one to be savagely critical, without being impolite," said Rushdie, still smarting at the way he was forced to skip the Jaipur Literature Festival this

The control a political family has over the inner democracy of a party is worrying. It may create a cult-like situation.

hina is no longer preparing, they have indeed entered the world and today, they find themselves in 2012 on the world stage, not quite knowing what to do or how to handle that sense of responsibility. Their arrival happened 20 years ahead of time based upon their own internal estimates, because the rest of the world has imploded economically. So along with China's rise to the world stage, there is a sense of real uncertainty today within the Chinese leadership about how to handle this high-profile position. We must all keep our eyes on the most important event that will take place later this year, the 18th Party Congress in October, the ruling, standing committee of the Politburo, the Board of Directors of the country if you will. Seven of

the nine members of the standing committee will change, as will the Central Military Commission, as will the Politburo, as will the Central Committee. We have an opportunity to forge a new dialogue of trust. The kind of relationship that will reflect where the US-China relationship has gone in recent years, which has taken it from simply a bilateral relationship to more of a global relationship, one that has to be globally focused from the economic standpoint, from a security standpoint. Longer term, the real objective between my country and China must be to build a relationship based on shared values because that's where we have a void. To that end, there is no better place to look in forging relationships than the US-India relationship.

Merely belonging to a political family isn't enough to ensure success. One does not inherit office in a democracy.
