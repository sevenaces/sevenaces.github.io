ANNA WANNA
Slogans, Anna topis, wicked cartoons, and a flag-waving Kiran Bedi. It was business as usual for the biggest event managers of the year, Team Anna, and their icon, this time at Mumbai's MMRDA Ground. Chant of the Day Twinkle, twinkle little star, Anna Hazare is our super star!
SIBAL

Slogan of the Day Sarkar kaa dhokha baar baar, ab ladai hogi aar yaa paar. T-shirt Slogan of the Day People want Jan Lokpal not Joke Pal. Cartoon of the Day From Kanpur-based Aseem Tripathi, who displayed cartoons of his favourite character, Digvijaya Singh, whom he has given a porcine honorific.

FIRE AND ICE
On a day the Lok Sabha passed the Lokpal Bill, the debate showed why Parliament is still the greatest reality show on Indian television. Where else will one find a feisty Lalu Prasad Yadav comparing the CBI under the Lokpal Bill to Draupadi, albeit with nine husbands? Or Speaker Meira Kumar treating fully grown MPs like naughty nursery brats, telling them "ho gaya, ho gaya na"? Or Pranab Mukherjee speaking of how "democracy has survived because of the strength of its institutions"? Here's more.

Definitive Statement of the Day From Pranab Mukherjee, "Parliament is meant for discussion, debate, decision and not disruption."

"Parliament can amend the Constitution but cannot fiddle with fundamentals". Angry Debater Kapil Sibal, who lapsed into Hindi jousting (apne ghar mein bhrashtachar apnao aur dusron pe aarop lagao) and Urdu shairi (Aisi vaisi baaton se to khamoshi hi behtar hai,

Ya phir aisi baat karo jo khamoshi se behtar ho) to defend the PM, who, he said, has been brought under the Lokpal in a "bulletproof jacket because you fire without any sense or reason". Quote of the Day From Yashwant Sinha, who insisted it was Manmohan Singh's farewell speech. "A morally bankrupt Government has brought not a Lokpal but a Brokerpal bill."

Rabble Rousers No doubt Lalu Prasad Yadav and Sharad Yadav. Lalu said Team Anna had already binned the Lokpal Bill so why the three-day kasrat? Sharad Yadav said "Lokpal desh ko thap kar dega."

BABY STEPS
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, 23, staked his claim to his mother's legacy, writing an op-ed in a Pakistani newspaper, The Express Tribune, on the fourth death anniversary of Benazir. Written in the royal plural, it emphasises what his mother could have done, had she had her way. With just a brief mention of his father who "saved" the nation after her assassination, he promises that his mother's dreams are now "my dreams" . "I will never give up on my mother's Pakistan. I will never give up on the woman who sacrificed herself so Pakistan could be free." This was, he says, his promise to her, and his promise to the people of Pakistan. We should all be worried.

O F T H E DAY

ALL FROM LALU PRASAD YADAV IN THE LOK SABHA We are worried about Anna's health, and we plan to make All India Anna Hazare Health Saving Scheme. Dear PM, we don't doubt your integrity, if you bring in a strong Lokpal Bill, we will make you the Lokpal.

DEADLY ATTACK

S

onia Gandhi once called Narendra Modi "maut ka saudagar". Vasundhara Raje says the title is more suitable for Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. At a function to commemorate Atal Bihari Vajpayee's birthday in Jaipur, she called Gehlot that because government doctors have repeatedly struck work during his three-year term. They are on strike again since December 21, angry about the government stalling an agreement signed with them on July 11.

PRESIDENTIAL PERKS Pratibha Devisingh Patil's 11-day visit till President January 4 and stay at the Rashtrapati Nilayam at
Bolarum in Secunderabad has cost the cashstrapped state exchequer Rs 50 crore. Various government departments are spending on sprucing up the 70-acre estate and the 20-room state building, shut for the rest of the year. They are also repairing the roads to ensure a smoother drive for the presidential entourage. With her term up in 2012, she can be forgiven for enjoying last-minute perks.

t's official. Rajinikanth is on Team Anna's side. In the current round of fasting to protest against the Lokpal Bill, more than 200 people went on a fast at a marriage hall owned by the Kollywood legend. After Anna Hazare's recent public meeting in Chennai, IAC (India Against Corruption) activists got in touch with the actor's wife, Latha, who offered the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, located in Kodambakkam, Chennai, free of cost. It was enough to spawn yet another Rajini joke. Rajinikanth lends wedding hall for fast. The fallout: Lokpal supports Rajinikanth.

SURPRISE OF THE WEEK

WEEK
You know society doesn't give a s*** about democracy when the civics exam in school is only 25 marks.

Robert Vadra was named the most stylish man by a popular vote in a Delhi newspaper supplement, to which a wag remarked on Twitter,"they obviously haven't seen him in a body stocking at Delhi's Lodi Gardens, where power-walkers converge" . Or indeed, we may add, in all leather at all-night parties.

"I would advise Vladimir Putin to step down now. It has been enough. Three terms is enough. Because otherwise, circles (close to powerful leaders) and clans form."
