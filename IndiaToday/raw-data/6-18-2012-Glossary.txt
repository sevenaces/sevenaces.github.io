TERMINAL DISASTER
Celebs headed for the 13th annual International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA) in Singapore. We spotted a few who were not dressed to impress at the Mumbai international airport.

VIRAL BHAYANI

Did Santa Claus decide to drop by early? Oh no, it was just Bipasha Basu on her way to IIFA. Nothing against her red trousers, white blouse or those black boots, but she needn't have put them all on together. That's a lot of luggage for two ageing men, but perhaps Randhir and Rajiv Kapoor have plenty more colour-coordinated outfits in there. They blended seamlessly with their bags. We get it that you are brothers, but drop the satchels please!

INDIAN TOUCH
Not everyday does a queen celebrate 60 years of being on the throne. So the glitter and fanfare on Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee was quite expected. What wasn't was a powder blue chiffon dupatta framing her pearls. It stayed in place as she rode in a carriage for the thanksgiving service at St. Paul's Cathedral. How nice of the old dear to go native on us.

We understand that Masaba Gupta wants to showcase her collection at the IIFA fashion show. She need not have looked like one of her models, but surely she could have skipped the cleavagepopping white top and long black pullover.

KAPOOR (LEFT) AND CHOPRA

Wonder what made Priyanka Chopra pay a surprise visit on the sets of Heroine? Apparently she was there to hang out with Kareena Kapoor and reconnect with director Madhur Bhandarkar. It happens when you lose a few friends.

CENTRE OFATTENTION
After the brickbats, it must have been nice for Aishwarya Rai Bachchan to get so much praise, especially from someone as dashing as 30 Rock star Alec Baldwin. The two came together for an interview on the Le Grand Journal, a TV show on Canal Studio, with Cannes Film Festival President Gilles Jacob. Even with his own pretty fiancee Hilaria Thomas by his side. Baldwin went on about how he was a fan, how much prettier Aishwarya looked after the baby and how she should hop across to Hollywood. His yoga-instructor fiancee may have got him to look trimmer, but perhaps memories of when he resembled a barrel are not so far away.

Hey tweetos, Yes now it's official. We finally did the naming ceremony today. Our son has been christened Vivaan Raj Kundra:) It means full of life or energy. Aren't we really happy?

KRISHNA

Shanghai has found an unlikely singer in IAS officer Srivatsa Krishna, 43. A college friend of director Dibakar Banerjee, he was roped in to sing Vishnu Sahasranamam (the thousand names of Lord Vishnu). The minute-long mantra is about the life of a Tamil Brahmin IAS officer played by Abhay Deol.

GOING DESI IN PARIS
India was everywhere at the French Open 2012. Mixed doubles pair Mahesh Bhupathi, 37, and Sania Mirza, 25, qualified for the finals, while Leander Paes, 38, along with his Russian partner Elena Vesnina, got into the semi-finals. It's time spectators at the Roland Garros learnt some Hindi now.

They chose India as the theme for Chanel's fall ad campaign, but stylist Carine Roitfeld, 57, and German fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, 78, got it all wrong. In the advertisement featuring Lagerfeld's Paris-Bombay collection, models sport mudras and maang tikas. A teapot placed in the background, which looks like a bar from the dark ages, is supposed to give a sense of India. How about a visit to India now for a real glimpse?
