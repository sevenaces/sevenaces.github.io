FUNERAL FASHION

The more celebrated Bollywood faces may have given veteran actor A.K. Hangal's last rites a miss, but they usually turn up in droves in their best whites at funerals

YOGEN SHAH

Priyanka Chopra was at cinematographer Ashok Mehta's last rites in a white kurta and churidar with her hair artfully covered. Did she have to look like she was stepping out for a film shoot? Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan's matching
white kurta pyjama was unavoidable but the cream shawl and scarf added a nice touch, so what if it screamed `we are family.'

At age 8, I was crowned the "Master of Farts" by my family. I consider it my biggest achievement till date. --Devika Bhagat, Screenplay writer

DANCE LIKE A STAR
Ranbir Kapoor's fans can now make him dance to their whims, or blow kisses. A YouTube application for promoting Barfi! allows users to type instructions and wait for his character from the film to enact it. But that doesn't mean he will do just about anything the user can think of. People will have to `try another mood' if they ask him to do something he `doesn't understand.' Hmm. Now if only we could understand.

ROHIT VERMA

Rohit Verma's long kurta, skirt-like trousers, headband and ponytail at Dara Singh's funeral was subdued compared to his usual flamboyance but the Bigg Boss 3 contestant stood out anyway.

Of all those who came for Ashok Mehta's last rites,

Shah Rukh Khan
looked the most distraught in scruffy jeans and stubble. He didn't even manage to comb his hair or button up his shirt.

SHAH RUKH KHAN

Caterina Lopez finally has something more to say about herself than that she is Jennifer Lopez's cousin. She was a bar dancer swivelling her hips in a red sari in Bhindi Bazaar Inc but now she gets to try her hand at acting in Siddharth Sharma's Wassup Kem Cho. Cast opposite TV actor Abhay Vakil, she dons a corporate look this time. There is also Paresh Rawal as a businessman, so we can always watch him if she turns out to be a disaster.

FROM MALLIKA TO DEVI
Dirty Politics may see the unlikely pairing of Mallika Sherawat and Om Puri. She will be up to her usual antics as a Rajasthani dancer Anokhi Devi who catches the eye of a politician.There is murder and a high profile investigation but director K.C. Bokadia insists he has only partly been inspired by Bhanwri Devi. Either way, there is plenty of scope for Sherawat's talents.

ROYAL SET OF WHEELS
A Rolls-Royce 20 HP Barker Tourer (GLK 21), parked with the royals of Udaipur for seven generations, is the first car from India to win the Lucius Beebe Trophy at the prestigious 62nd annual Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance event in California. "It was even retro-fitted to accommodate cricket teams," says Arvind Singh, 76th Custodian of the House of Mewar.

A SHORT ENGAGEMENT
Raima Sen decided to jumpstart her waning popularity by tweeting that she was getting married to Varun Thapar and even posted pictures. A turnaround followed hours later with her declaring that he was only her best friend.

--Karisma Kapoor

Why mess around with images of Urmila Matondkar, 38, dancing on the rocks with Jackie Shroff leering at her from afar in Rangeela in 1995? Marathi film Hridaynath brings them together again with disastrous results.There is Urmila dancing to lavani item number Ya Na as Shroff, a timid school teacher-turned-rogue showers her with money. A return to Rangeela this most definitely is not.
