ON FEBRUARY 11, Rahul Gandhi's helicopter landed at Soraon district near Amethi Allahabad to a resounding Sultanpur welcome. "UP ka bhavishya Rae Bareli aaya hai (The future of Uttar Pradesh is here)," said an Pratapgarh excited compere as local Allahabad Congress leaders pegged the crowd as 10,000 strong. This Total 744 km seemed probable. Some had travelled four hours to hear Rahul speak. But the show was over the minute the Congress general secretary left. The crowd dispersed immediately, as did the sundry leaders who had been preening on the dais. Allahabad went to polls on February 15. Four days after Rahul's successful rally, the mood in Soraon had changed. "Rahulji ki baat alag hai (Rahul is different). We have no problem with him. But he is at the Centre, our work is with the local MLA," said a youth who had attended the rally, clapped for him but voted for the Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate Satyaveer Munna. According to the locals, the vote here is a fight between the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), SP and the BJP. The standing MLA is from the BSP. The inability to convert crowds at Rahul's rallies into voters is a glaring deficit in the Congress campaign. Rahul has tried to make up for the lack of a cadre by deploying Youth Congress workers from all over India. But they still retain the tag of outsiders; as does Rahul him-

"I wanted Rahulji to be projected as chief minister. I suggested this but was told he has to be the VIP MPs and the locals, the vote here is still in favour of prime minister.

It is this same goodwill that is working for the Gandhi SP, BJP and the Congress picking up one each. Now the fight seems to be largely between SP and BSP, with the former family. This allows Priyanka to placate a woman worker having an edge in rural pockets. As a farmer in protesting against the shutdown of a local garment factory Mansurabad village near Allahabad says, "Mayawati did simply by pulling her cheeks. A villager in Gauriganj still remembers how the late little for farmers. Mulayam (Singh Yadav, SP chief) and Rajnath Singh (BJP) helped us. It looks as if SP is winning, Rajiv Gandhi had visited his hut and had tea with him. "Abki baar nahin jeetenge toh phir Rahul ka chance nikal so we voted for Mulayam."

"We will definitely increase our vote share," says a party MP, pointing out that if the Congress won one seat in every district, it will have a minimum of 74 seats. "Hum izzat ki ladai ladh rahe hain (We are fighting with dignity)," says Surendra Rajput, a party leader from Lucknow, pointing out that since the elections were announced Rahul has held 125-126 sabhas (meetings). "Even if you take a bare minimum of 8,000 people at each meeting, at least 32,000 people hear him everyday," he adds. After a 22-year absence, Rahul and his chief aide Digvijaya Singh have ensured that the Congress is once again part of the Uttar Pradesh poll rhetoric. But when party leaders start talking about vote percentages instead of seats, then you know that expectations are being managed. There is a banner put up by a Congress candidate in the heart of Hazratganj in Lucknow which says `Dilli Rahi Hamaari Hai, Ab UP Ki Baari Hai (Delhi is ours, now it is Uttar Pradesh's turn)'. It is clearly easier for the Congress to rule in Delhi than to wrest control of Uttar Pradesh.

THE ELECTION Commission lists Gulshan Bindu as O Faizabad (Other) in the gender category. She is a kinnar (eunuch) and promises to bring Jalaun about massive change in the dusty political landscape of Banda the temple town Ayodhya. Hamirpur Jhansi Contesting as an independTotal 900 km ent candidate, Bindu, 43, may not win but she is likely to secure enough votes to dethrone five-time BJP MLA Lallu Singh, something that other parties have hitherto failed to do. Lallu, representing Ayodhya since 1991, is definitely unnerved by the `third presence'. In the run-up to the elections, he even complained to the Election Commission that she was violating the code of conduct by making people promise to vote for her. Traditionally, it is considered inauspicious if a promise made to a eunuch is not kept. Conversely, a blessing from a eunuch is supposed to bring luck. Erstwhile king of Ayodhya Vimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra, 63, or Pappu Bhaiya as he is popularly known, says Bindu's presence has upset all poll predictions in Ayodhya. "She will surely get at least 10,000 votes," he says. Lallu had won by a margin of 5,741 votes over his nearest rival, the SP's Indra Pratap Tiwari, in 2007. A large voter turnout in the belt, including Assembly seats in the Ambedkar Nagar Lok Sabha constituency that polled in the first phase, has also made the contest interesting. Pappu, who had himself unsuccessfully contested Lok Sabha elections on a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket in 2009, feels his party, which has fielded Ved Prakash Gupta to wean the Bania vote away from BJP, has a good chance of winning. Gupta had crossed over from SP just before the

elections after it denied him a ticket and preferred to field 30-year-old Tej Narayan Pandey alias Pawan Pandey, a member of Akhilesh Yadav's youth brigade. Pandey hit the headlines in December 2011 when the Election Commission forced him to scale down his lavish poll-time wedding plans by holding out the threat of including it in his poll expenditure. He is likely to benefit from votes getting divided among Bindu and candidates of the Congress, BSP and the Peace Party, a key player this time. Sitting in his small one-room tenement in Ayodhya, Mohammad Hashim Ansari, 92, the oldest litigant in the original Ayodhya title suit, expresses the angst of Muslim voters. "Everyone uses us only as a vote bank and does nothing. Look at the city of Ayodhya. It is disintegrating. I am saying it today that I do not want a masjid. I want development, as do all other Muslims and also Hindus. All parties are fighting for kursi (power) and currency. Religion is merely a garb," he says. Ansari is voting for the Peace Party this time. "They have put up a Hindu candidate (Rajesh Mishra) but Muslims are voting for him," he says.

mong the various castes and classes, there is visible animosity. Kushal Rani, 55, a Nishad from Ranipur village, says that the benefits of various government schemes, including the Indira Awas Yojana and Mukhya Mantri Mahamaya Garib Arthik Madad Yojana, have all been hogged by the Dalits. "Sab Daliton ko mil raha hai. Shauchalya bhi (Dalits are getting everything. Even toilets)," she says. The houses belonging to Dalits are visibly better. Ambedkar Nagar is not the only BSP bastion in danger of falling. BJP leader Uma Bharati has made inroads into the Bundelkhand region, where BSP holds 13 of the 19 Assembly seats. The region remained in the headlines from 2005 to 2010 for one of the worst droughts in the history of independent India. But 2012 has had a good monsoon. The Centre, too, pitched in with a Rs 7,000 crore package for the region.

A

In Bundelkhand, as in Ambedkar Nagar, the Dalits themselves are a divided lot. "Last time, we voted for BSP but this time we have other options," says Komal Singh, 42, member of the Sahariya Scheduled Caste and former pradhan of Bajna village in Babina constituency of Jhansi district. He says Mayawati has not done enough for nonJatav Dalits. On the other hand, 17-year-old Brajesh Ahirwar, from the nearby Bamer village, says, "Mayawati has done enough for the poor people. Dalit votes cannot be divided." The Class XI student, who belongs to the same caste as Mayawati, isn't a voter yet but seems well-versed with the power struggle at the hustings. One thing emerges clearly--the road is not so smooth for BSP this time. As one travels from Jhansi to Chitrakoot through Hamirpur, Mahoba and Banda districts of the region, the political scene becomes more and more complex. In Mahoba, BJP is much better placed, thanks to the presence of Bharati who has emerged as the face of the party in the elections. She is contesting from Charkhari, her first ever election in the state. A Lodh by caste, she chose this seat with a population of 50,000-plus Lodhs. She has been sticking to a rigorous schedule ever since she launched her campaign on February 18 from Belatal town. She starts her day with Surya puja at the picturesque colonial-era rest house atop a hill with a pond beside it. Then after a visit to the local temple, she gets on to her `rath'--a Volvo bus. It is followed by a white Tata Safari. She has to abandon the Volvo soon for the Tata Safari as the roads are not wide enough for the `rath'.

Even the handful of men at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas workshop in Ayodhya are disillusioned with BJP. They chip away at huge concrete pillars, hoping that the Ram temple will be built soon. By their own admission, however, things are moving slowly. "You should have come before the elections. This rusted machine you see here was pressed into use so that the voters think BJP is serious about the temple," says Ram Niwas Mishra, 32, pointing to the huge stone cutting machine, as he sat cleaning an engraved pillar. "Lallu is not going to be elected again. He has been MLA for 20 years and done nothing for the people. Na mandir na vikas (Neither mandir nor development)," Mishra adds. Then who? "Probably SP. Or even BSP. Woh din bhi aayega jab Ram ke ghar Dalit party raj karegi (That day will come when a Dalit party will rule over Lord Rama's birthplace)," he says. A two-hour drive away on potholed roads to Ambedkar Nagar, the Dalit party is not doing too well. It is not difficult to imagine why pollsters are predicting an adverse turn of fortune for BSP. Then called Akbarpur, it was party founder Kanshi Ram's "social laboratory" where he put together the Dalits and Most Backward Castes (Nishads, Rajbhars) to consolidate BSP's vote bank. A party stronghold in 2007, when it swept all five Assembly seats, BSP is now struggling to hold on to even one. The Congress had established its presence in the district in the Lok Sabha elections. The Katehari and Akbarpur Assembly seats are showing a break in the political combination this time. The caste factor is not working. People want jobs, roads, electricity and development. Ramsanehi Ram, head of the BSP booth committee in Ranipur village under Katehari Assembly constituency, admits that they failed to ensure that the Nishad vote stays with the party. Mayawati, who represented the Akbarpur Lok Sabha seat from 1998 to 2007, has put all her efforts into the district, even accommodating three of the five party MLAs as ministers. However, people here appear to be in no mood to be kind to her. "How long will we continue to be taken in by caste politics? A lot of youth like me have moved out to look for jobs," says Mahabal, 25, who works in Amritsar.

If our party comes to power, I will bring back people's money even if it means having to pull it out of the throats of the corrupt.

At public meetings, she is at her aggressive best, hitting out at all other parties, and reserving her best pot shots for Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati. Amid slogans of `Bharat Mata Ki Jai' and `Jai Shri Ram', her cavalcade trundles along. Bharati tells INDIA TODAY that she is not an outsider in the state: "I am here to change the state and to serve the people of Uttar Pradesh." Trying to quell the rumours of a rift within BJP because of her, she says, "The state BJP leaders have accepted me as one of them. The party is united and will do well." She says she is not in the race for chief ministership. "Mujhe UP ka mukhyamantri nahi banna. Main Charkhari ki janta ki santri hi theek hoon (I do not want to become Uttar Pradesh chief minister. I am happy being a servant of the people of Charkhari)," she says. Spelling out her agenda, Bharati says Bundelkhand is rich in minerals and other natural resources but these resources are controlled by some powerful people. "I will change all this. Bundelkhand is one of the most backward regions of the country. If BJP comes to power, I will make it the most developed region in three years. Jisne bhi janta ka paisa khaya hai uske tentue mein ungli daal kar paisa nikalungi (I will bring back people's money even if it means having to pull it out of the throats of the corrupt)," she says. She desists from commenting on BSP import Babu Singh Kushwaha, who is being used by BJP to target the backward vote, including in the Bundelkhand area. She had publicly opposed his induction into the party. "After he himself withdrew from party membership, the matter is closed," she

Rahul Sinha, 35, schoolteacher in Ghazipur, is convinced that Mayawati will win in his constituency. "Casteism is still very strong here and I have seen crowds wherever she went." Agrees Amit Chowbey, 24, a Ghazipur-based Brahmin videographer who served as a polling booth agent for BJP on February 15. With 61 per cent turnout from among 1,300 voters, he estimates, "SP and BJP are likely to get 150 each, BSP 400, Congress 50." The rest will be split among independent candidates and the new parties: Mayawati is Peace Party, Apna Dal or Quami Ekta Dal.

"Every political party has People resent distributed money in my that distance. village.

There is no corDEEPAK MALLIK Professor, BHU roboration for this nugget. It is Mayawati vs Mulayam in Purvanchal, with Congress on the margins. That's the story along the 400km-stretch from Ghazipur, Mau, Bahadurganj, Kasimabad to Rasra in Ballia. In Bahadurganj near Mau, Nassem Khan, 40, runs a sprawling English-medium school, Blooming Buds, with 32 staff and 1,000 students. "The fight will be between BSP and SP. Congress will gain seats. And some votes will go to the influential local mafia," she says. A flock of teenagers on bikes, mostly first-time voters, at Azad Chowk in Rasra narrate the same story. Nadeem Ansari, BA final student of DAV College, is excited: "All eyes are on Rasra. It's opening up after 40 years of being a reserved seat." Except for BSP, top leaders from all parties came, he says. "SP is likely to win." 2007 was a surprise year. Mayawati had cobbled together an unusual marriage of castes that do not marry. 2012 promises to see the ungluing of that "social engineering", with urban youth and Brahmins gravitating toward Congress, Muslims inching toward Mulayam and other upper castes flip-flopping between BJP, Congress and SP. "It's not just her failure in governance," says political analyst Deepak Mallik, professor of BHU and director, Institute of Gandhian Studies. "Although caste is the basic affiliation here, there is a new awareness that the state is stagnating and needs to forge ahead." Varanasi moves from carnival to carnival without missing a beat: the election fever has given way to the thrill of Shivratri. The political matrix of the state may change dramatically on March 6, when the results will be out. But Holi will soon take over. Just a blip in the history of the world's most ancient city. 

says. Unable to resist taking a dig at Rahul, she adds, "I have heard so much about his Bundelkhand package but I cannot see it anywhere at the grassroots level. Either it never came or it has been swallowed on the way."

It is the bastion of Muslims, owners and weavers of the Benarasi sari trade. Congress voters by tradition, they have gravitated toward SP due to repeated communal riots in the area, especially the last one in 1992. "Some of the wellknown families here determine public opinion," explains Irshad Ansari, embroidery machines merchant. "Blood line, network and loyalty play a crucial role." The Taj Baba family is one such. Brothers Gulrez, 29, and Gulfroz Ahmed, 26, admire Anna Hazare. There has been no tactical voting by Muslims in order to defeat BJP by any means this time, they say. "Narendra Modi or Varun Gandhi were not brought in to campaign, hence security was not an issue for Muslims. People have voted by candidate," says Gulrez. Sixty per cent votes would go to SP and 40 per cent to Congress, they estimate. Varanasi Muslims are secular, increasingly educated and are asking why the Sachar Committee recommendations have not been implemented. "We are businessmen, we can give jobs, we can give tax but we need the atmosphere to improve our trade," says Gulfroz. Hence, they are "dimagh se SP, dil se Congress (SP by calculation, Congress by heart)". In other words, they have voted for Mulayam Singh Yadav. Young Muslim women have their own views. Teachers of the prestigious girls' school, Quadratulla Gulzar E Taleem in Reori Talab, have largely voted for Rahul--quietly, without consulting family members. Mostly unmarried, they all have advanced degrees in a range of subjects, sociology to maths. Political discussions happen around the dining table at home, says Sabera, 24, where she has declared, "Meri marzi main jisko bhi doon (I'll vote as I please)". For most of them,

a candidate's track record in corruption, governance and national reach matters. "I chose Rahul because he is not married," says Anjum Kaina, 22. "He will do more for the country. Marriage makes people self-centred." Students of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) zoom around the campus in bikes, girls with their faces masked, Ninja style. Nobody hesitates to speak their mind or get into a fight when it comes to politics. Do they expect any change this time? "Yes, of course," say commerce students Siddhartha, Anket, Nancy, Harish, Karnveer, Neha, Pragya, Akansha, some being first-time voters. They come from well-off, educated upper-caste families and are inspired as much by Hazare as Modi. "We don't go by caste, but candidate," they say, as words like truthful, clean, and character do the rounds. Some expect BSP votes to go to SP and BJP, others want Congress to win--for Rahul, of course. If `Sapa' (SP, locally) and Congress are the talking points in the city, Mayawati is the vote-grabber in the countryside. "Who did you vote for?" A woman with salt-and-pepper hair in a Dalit basti of Aura village, 12 km from Varanasi, retorts, "Why should I tell you?" with hands-on-hips defiance and Bhojpuri bluntness. Women around her peal with laughter. "If you harass us, we will slap the Harijan Act on you." She refuses to give her name or age but finally reveals her preference: "Yes, we have all voted for Behenji." Will Mayawati become the chief minister? She leaves it to "kismet": "Hathi ke sundh me chiuti chali gayi, to hathi gayi (Even an elephant dies if an ant gets into its trunk)." And she talks realpolitik: "Don't think we are voting by caste. We will vote for anyone who treats us well."

ON FEBRUARY 16, just a day after eastern Uttar Pradesh went to polls, the long road Gorakhpur from Babatpur airport to Varanasi looks forlorn. With Azamgarh the Election Commission Ghazipur Chandauli keeping a vigilant eye, there Varanasi are no campaign billboards Mirzapur hanging over the landscape, Ballia no poster wars. Still, bicycle Total 800 km graffiti of the Samajwadi Party (SP) makes a surprise appearance. Two warring candidates from Congress and BJP stare at each other from two massive hoardings. But there is no sign of Chief Minister Mayawati's electoral might on the streets. In the heart of Varanasi, Dashashvamedh Ghat is a riot of faces, colours and sound after sunset. The chant of ancient prayers wafts through the soothing breeze from the Ganga. Hundreds of tiny candle-lit prayer-boats float on the river. Young men in colourful dhoti-kurta perform Ganga Arti under floodlights in carefully choreographed movements, their conch shells casting a spell. "Gau hatya bandh ho. Ahamkar naash ho (Let cow slaughter end. Let ego be destroyed)," they end the day's worship and head off to their river-front dorms. Within 15 minutes they are back, unrecognisable in tees and jeans, tattoos, ear studs, gelled hair and friendship bands. About 25,000-strong and spread across all 92 ghats of Varanasi, the 20-something yuva pandas are the new face of the city's 3,000-year-old history of punditry. Who did they vote for? "Our gurujis asked us to vote for Congress," says Sandeep Pandey, 22, who is also doing his masters at the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University. Why? "I don't know. We just did what they asked us to." Another claims to have cast 20 votes for a Congress candidate, removing ink stains from his finger with a blade each time. Their `khadi boli' gives way to `thet Hindustani' just five metres away. "Ka ho, guru (What's up, man)," Ganga boatmen greet each other as they sip tea at the Tanga chai stall and discuss Rahul Gandhi's promise to renovate the Ghat. "Woh achchey lagtey hain (We like him)," they say. But Sitaram, 75, mendicant for the last seven years, says he has voted for Mayawati "because everybody did", before sidling off to the free-food counter, Narayana Bhoj, for his dinner. Madanpura, just five minutes away from the Ghat, is lined with huge mansions, their intricately carved facades sheltering shops on the ground floors: perfumeries, tent vendors, sweet shops and Benarasi showrooms. Men in saffron walk elbow to elbow with men in crochet skull caps.
