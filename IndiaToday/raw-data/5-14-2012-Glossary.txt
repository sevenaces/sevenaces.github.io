GLOSSARY

THE STRIP CLUB
Nisha Yadav flits between calling herself Ameesha Yadav and a `Southern Siren' and specialises in going without clothes. Her last Hindi film Corruption: The Curse, inspired by Anna Hazare, showed her in the buff. She is doing it again--this time to get Mumbai's drains cleaned before the monsoons for a campaign called `Bash the trash and damn the plastic'. Nice. But what is the connection with no clothes?

With bold acts becoming commonplace and starlets going topless, nudity gets a new twist. There is nothing like a `good cause' to get these girls to shed their clothes.
Kate Moss has donated a topless picture of herself to raise money for charity. Shot by Norwegian photographer Solve Sundsbo, the picture has her wearing only a pair of shiny pants and will be auctioned by the National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children on May 17 in London.

Rozlyn Khan was raising awareness about breast cancer in April, through a topless self-examination video. This month found the starlet in a bathtub submerged in a red liquid representing blood. In between splashing about, she said how she was protesting against cosmetic testing on animals. At least she seemed to be having fun.

THE BIG PLUNGE
Two television actors are moving to the big screen. Sushant Singh Rajput, 26, and Amit Sadh, 31, will be seen in the on-screen adaptation of Chetan Bhagat's third novel 3 Mistakes Of My Life. Rajput, who is popular as Manav in the TV series Pavitra Rishta, plays Ishaan, a cricket enthusiast. Sadh, who made his debut in Kyun Hota Hai Pyaar on Star Plus in 2002, will essay the role of Omi, the confused son of a Hindu priest. Rajput has also signed an international film Roaring Silence. Sadh, who was last seen in Ram Gopal Varma's Phoonk 2, will also be seen in Kabeer Kaushik's crime thriller Maximum.

RAZDAN

CRIME OF PASSION
Aamir Khan wanted to make a film on the infamous Nanavati murder case of the '50s. But actor-turned-filmmaker Soni Razdan got there first. It will be produced by Pooja Bhatt's Fisheye Network and Dino Morea's Clockwork Films. Razdan will write the film with husband Mahesh Bhatt and scriptwriter Selina Sheth. Hopefully this one is not another sleazy crime thriller.

HA HA HAIR

The Master Blaster's ever-changing hair is not what we want him to flaunt in the Rajya Sabha

MANDHAR DEODHAR/www.indiatodayimages.com

Sachin Tendulkar was seen sporting three different hairstyles at recent public events. At the launch of Mumbai Indians' Mickey merchandise on April 5 at The Trident, Mumbai, his curls were blow-dried and given a messy look. In Pune on May 1 to inaugurate a cricket museum called Blades of Glory, we saw him with straight hair, while on May 2, he had a parting with a pokerstraight fringe. New look for the Rajya Sabha, is it?

SINGH

SERIOUS BUSINESS
Former item girls Neha Dhupia and Isha Koppikar haven't had the greatest of acting careers. So it's no surprise that the two have other business on their minds. Even as Dhupia awaits the release of her delayed film Rush opposite Emraan Hashmi, she has launched an online portal for lingerie and fragrance. Sparked by her own addiction to online shopping, she spent months designing the website with a team. Close on her heels is Koppikar, who is back after her two-month hospitality course in the US to open her own chain of health restaurants. Also on the anvil is a production house. Marriage to restaurateur Timmy Narang has ignited the entrepreneur in her.

THIRD TIME LUCKY?
The decision has been made. It's Chitrangda Singh who will find herself sandwiched between Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor in Sudhir Mishra's Mehrunissa. After considering most of Bollywood's leading women, the director has settled for his Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi actor to play the female lead in the epic love story. It's his third film with the actor. Now it is up to Singh to make the most of it to rescue her career.

FAN FOLLOWING
Rajesh Khanna, 69, was recovering from a broken leg when he shot for his first television ad for Havells fans directed by R. Balki. But he insisted on doing the walking himself in the ad that looks back at the time when fans would follow him everywhere he went. Table fans may have replaced living fans, but not bad, Kaka.
