KEN? BORIS? TRY SIOBHAN
British Labour Party politician Ken Livingstone and current Mayor Boris Johnson are creating the biggest ripples in the London mayoral election campaign.The quiet voice of a successful working mother, Siobhan Benita, 40, who just resigned from her high-ranking government job to run in the election, is rising above the noise.The daughter of an AngloIndian mother and Cornish dad, Benita is being seen as a modern, credible alternative to Johnson and Livingstone. Her youth-oriented campaign and polished pitch have got UK newspapers talking. Benita's grandmother migrated to London from India and she refers to the story to evoke a capital that is multi-cultural.We don't know about the British, but she is winning hearts here.

Nana Patekar's son Malhar's attempts at being launched as an actor failed. But the 27-year-old has decided to work behind the camera. He will be assistant director to Ram Gopal Varma in his next film which is based on the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai. "I haven't achieved anything and this is not the right time for publicity," he says. Modest.

MODEL STATES
From pens to hair oils, detergent powders to undergarments, Bollywood celebrities are putting their names on everything. The new--and may we say, more respectable?-- trend is to put a famous face on states. Aamir Khan started the trend when he became the brand ambassador of Incredible India. Amitabh Bachchan followed with Gujarat and the newest entrants are Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. While Shah Rukh recently confirmed endorsing West Bengal, things went international for Salman when an ad filmmaker asked him to be the face of Cuban tourism, while he was shooting the forthcoming Ek Tha Tiger there. If nothing else, at least these deals will get them cool vacations.
