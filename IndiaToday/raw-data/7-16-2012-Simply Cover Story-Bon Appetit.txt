BON Appétit
TREATYOUR TASTEBUDS WITH OUR PICK OFTHE BEST FOOD YOUR CITY HAS TO OFFER
elhi is considered as the potboiler of national and international cuisines, with celebrated chefs whipping up everything from teppanyaki grills to lesser known Indian curries. SIMPLY DELHI takes you on a gastronomic trail to explore the best eateries to satiate your appetite.

Bukhara
Bukhara is perhaps the only fine dining restaurant that encourages `not-so-fine-dining' and the sight of diners licking their fingers after a sumptuous meal is quite common here. But then food has always been the highlight at this oft-awarded restaurant which has managed to retain its iconic status for 33 years now. The ambience at this 130 cover restaurant is casual yet rustic, with cooking accessories such as copper vessels hung on the walls. There are no napkins or cutlery on the wooden tables and you're made to put on an apron before you start your meal. Their limited menu has not featured a single addition since the restaurant's inception. Over the years, the delectable fare here has ensured an increasing number of patrons visiting Bukhara--their Sikandari raan (the whole leg of spring lamb, marinated in a mixture of malt vinegar, cinnamon and black cumin braised in the marinade) and

D

Kainoosh
Opulent interiors, soft music and dimly lit lanterns will make you forget that you're seated inside a shopping mall! The intricate jali or latice work adorning the walls recreates the magic of the Mughal era, while the chic white upholstery adds a contemporary touch to the restaurant. Brainchild of culinary maestro Marut Sikka, 43, and wife Anusuiya, 39, Kainoosh promises a treat not just your eyes but also your palate. Recently nominated for the Miele Guide 2012, which will feature Asia's Top 20 restaurants (to be out in September), the restaurant offers an interesting and extensive menu comprising a host of Indian dishes which aren't available anywhere else (for example the bharwan guchchi). We recommend you start your meal with the chatpata gram flour coated spinach (crispy palaak chaat); light, and crunchy, the spices will slowly explode in your mouth. At Kainoosh, vegetarians will not feel neglected as there is plenty to choose from--bharwa tandoori mushroom, kurkuri awjaini bhindi, bharwa guchchi, aachari baingan and more. We recommend meat eaters to indulge in the mouth watering laal maas, or the sumptuous ghosht korma pulao. Of course desert is a must here, so try the Trio kulfi, rich and creamy, with just the perfect amount of sweetness. Delicious food, gorgeous interiors and the excellent service will turn you into a regular once you've eaten here.

dal Bukhara (black lentils cooked for 14 to 16 hours) have had a loyal fan following for decades. Apart from these hot sellers, their kebab platters including the barrah kebabs (Chunks from leg of lamb and lamb chops marinated in a mixture of yoghurt and malt vinegar headed with a melange of spices char grilled over red hot embers) and tandoori salad (onions, capsicum, tomatoes, paneer and pineapple, straight from the tandoor) are must-tries.

Smoke House Room
Overlooking the towering Qutab Minar, Smoke House Room scores high on style and sophistication. The latest entrant into the niche genre of molecular cuisine, it boasts of chic, all-white interiors, attention to detail and beautiful presentation. The service is impeccable and most of the ingredients at this European restaurant are imported. Every item that makes its way to your table has touches of the exotic-the olive oil served with bread is infused with orange, and the chicken is cooked in three different ways to bring out various textures. The Grand Degustation, which is a nine course set menu, includesscallops, black cod, angus, foie gras, different kinds of mushrooms and more. Priced at Rs.7,000 per person, you might want to reserve this one for a special occasion. We do, however, strongly recommend the molecular cocktails. Try the Deconstructed Watermelon Caipiroska; it's chilled, fruity and beautifully mixed, with a thin slice of melon at the bottom of a long-stemmed glass. For dessert, go for the strange sounding Beet Cake. It looks and tastes just like chocolate, but is a much healthier option. SHR offers novel and perfectly cooked dishes, but the small portions might leave you craving for more!

The China Kitchen

REUBEN SINGH/www.indiatodayimages.com

Overlooking the pool at Hyatt Regency, huge wooden doors welcome you to The China Kitchen. Debatably the best Chinese restaurant in the city, this is also the only restaurant to serve Beijing's most famous dish, the Peking duck. As you enter, an open kitchen with five sections will grab your attention--Peking Duck, Dumplings and Noodles, Steam, The Wok and The Dessert Kitchens respectively. The overhead wooden beams, earthy interiors, earthenware on the tables, and soft Oriental music recreate the feel of the Far East. At The China Kitchen, all the ingredients are imported from China, as are the chefs! The restaurant claims that 50 labourers from China were called to help build this restaurant. Start your meal here with the hot and sour soup--served in an earthen pot, the aroma of the spices will fill your senses as soonas you lift the lid. The chicken dumplings have a very thin layer of dough on them and simply melt in your mouth. When here, the Peking duck is, of course, a must try. Roasted in an old-fashioned wood oven, it is brought to your table where the chef himself carves the bird for you. The skin is crisp while the inside is tender and juicy. The service here is prompt and you can see the chefs in action while enjoying your meal. Don't forget to save room for dessert--try the chocolate fondue served with fresh fruits, brownies, cookies, and ice cream--it's a sinful delight to end your meal. A cup of jasmine tea at the end will help digest the food.

Nizamuddin Eateries
Hazrat Nizamuddin's Dargah, considered one of the last great Sufi abodes is also a haven for carnivorous street food delights like kebabs, tikkas, nihari and more. The Dargah itself can be accessed by three alleyways, all lined with Mughlai eateries serving some of the most exquisite naharis, keema, roganjosh and of course kebabs. Stalls begin doleing out the tasty eats at around six in the evening and are open till well past midnight. While most of these hole-in-the-wall joints serve sumptuous meals, a safe, time-tested bet would be the kebab joint, Ghalibs which can seat not more than 20 people at a time at its no-fuss wooden tables and sturdy chairs. The only décor here is the framed picture of the holy shrine at Mecca on the wall. Yet despite this, crowds flock to Ghalibs to enjoy their tikkas and kebabs, either on a sole mission to enjoy the feast here or as a stopover after a visit to the Dargah. When here, apart from the beef seekh kebabs, be sure to try their shammi kebabs as well as their mutton qorma. Another joint you shouldn't miss is the Nasr Iqbal restaurant known for its mutton qorma and generous servings of butter chicken. DON'T MISS Beef tikka, Beef seekh kebab, mutton roganjosh, shammi kebabs, firni AVERAGE MEAL FOR TWO Rs 200 AT Near Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah, Nizamuddin

Karims
There is a good reason why Karims is probably the most-written about Mughlai eatery in town. The answer to this lies neither in the restaurateurs' claim that their culinary heritage can be traced back to the kitchens of the Mughal emperors, nor in the reasonable pricing of all the sumptuous offerings here. Rather it is probably mixed up somewhere amidst the exquisite coming together of spices and meat of their signature preparations like the mutton barrah or their Jahangiri qorma. Karims is more than just a good place to dine out--it's an eating experience. Be sure to work up a healthy appetite before you head down to this eatery. The décor is as simple as the food is complex, with the rich tastes of the Mughal kitchens shining through in even simple preparations like their peeli dal. The seating set up is functional and fuss free, with basic wooden chairs and tables spread over three separate levels. The interiors are fairly plain, and the emphasis is not on ambience, their focus is simply the food. A downside at Karims is the waiting time, as it could take up to half hour for a table, especially during peak hours.

Also try some of their other Italian specials like the cannelloni (stuffed with spinach and ricotta cheese and served with tomato and cream sauce) or the Chorizo amatriciana (chorizio pork, salami, tomato sauce and chili).

Amici
This year-old set up at Saket is the best option in town for authentic Italian pizzas. Serving Italian cuisine with their specialty being wood-fire oven baked pizzas, they are definitely a class apart from the standard fare that is offered by American-styled pizza joints. Gourmet pizzas such as the Pepe (with parma ham, bocconcini, mozzarella, rocket leaves and parmesan) are simply delicious. The 45 seater restaurant is designed to blend in with the mall where it is located and the décor laid out like a cafeteria, is ideal not only for sumptuous eats at any time of the day, but also for

Swagath
Any true-blue Delhiite knows that the best, time-tested venue for coastal delights is the Swagath restaurant chain. With multiple outlets in the city, the joint at Hotel Janpath is dimly lit, and done up in warm tones. The food here is exquisite and among the dishes that have enthralled its clientele for many years are the Surmai koliwada or Paneer koliwada--a dish that is prepared by wrapping the fish or paneer in a bed of suji followed by deep frying it. The dish is served with a special chutney that adds to its flavour. If you wish to eat crab or lobster, then you will be asked to choose one from the live display before it's cooked and served. For main course, be sure to try the chicken Malabari served with Malabar parantha. Order a plate of appam and neer dosa to accompany your main course dishes.

Big Chill
With eye-catching posters of Hollywood classics adorning the walls and pop music playing in the background, Big Chill exudes a chilled out, laid-back vibe. A popular hub for Delhi's young, `cool bunch', the place serves sumptuous American-Italian fare. Indulge here with all the pasta dishes on the menu being served with generous toppings of parmesan and the desserts that are delectably sinful. While pasta and vodka make for an interesting combo, we suggest you try the spaghetti bolognese or chicken lasagna, both of which are equally appetising. However, Big Chill's showstopper is their array of desserts. Take your pick from their homemade ice creams that come in a variety of flavours, from vanilla kit-kat to mint oreo. Their extra smooth cheesecakes won't disappoint either, even if the sluggish service and the waiting line outside the restaurant that doesn't take reservations do.

MEGU
Walk into this plush, uber sophisticated space at the Leela Palace and take a moment to admire the huge fiberglass bell that hangs from the centre of the ceiling, acting as a canopy to the large transparent Buddha sculpture that sits in the centre of the room. This Buddha statue is an identical replica of the ice carved one that sits in MEGU, New York. Having recently opened its doors in India, MEGU has moved beyond the cliché of sushi and sashimi, promising the Delhi foodie an experience of modern Japanese food unlike any other. Start your meal with the wonderfully delicate Yellowtail carpaccio, moving onto the luscious, melt-in-your-mouth baked Unagi and avocado. Don't forget to ask for some authentic wasabi root that the waiter will grate

fresh on a piece of shark skin, at your table. For main course, we insist that you order the MEGU Signature River Stone Grill--premium Wagyu steak, lightly seasoned and served with delectable sauces, cooked on river stones at your table. Of course, to accompany the meal, a glass of Harushika Happo Junmaishu (sparkling sake) is a must, all the more so, since MEGU is the only restaurant in Delhi that carries it. Wrap up your meal with a serving of the unusual yet delectable Wasabi cheesecake.

Trishna
Delhi might be a miles and miles from the sea but that is no reason for Dilliwallahs to miss out on delicious seafood fare. And it was with this thought that the Impresario group has launched Trishna, Mumbai's popular seafood restaurant here in Delhi. Located overlooking the Qutub Minar, Trishna promises not only a great view of the iconic structure, but also a fare that is as exquisite as it is alien to this part of the country. With their cuisine being an amalgamation of dishes from the coasts of the Konkan, Maharashtra, Mangalore and the Coromandel, there is no dearth of choice here. Their signature dish, crab butter pepper garlic is the highlight of the menu. With crabs, lobsters and shrimp varieties being flown in every week from Sri Lanka, authenticity is an inherent attribute here.

The 70 seater eatery provides the option of either dining indoors, where the interiors are done up in shades of white and radiate a suave yet casual ambience, or you can choose to dine in their terrace area overlooking the minar and set up with gazebos and low lit tables. Be sure to try some of the other house specials like prawn koliwada for starters, Pomfret kalimiri and dal Hyderabadi from their main course listings. Appam or neer dosa are excellent choices that go along with any of their main course dishes. DON'T MISS Pomfret tandoori tikka, Trishna special mutton, crab butter pepper garlic AVERAGE MEAL FOR TWO Rs 3,000 plus taxes (without alcohol) AT Qutub Minar Road, Mehrauli, New Delhi TEL 26645477

Gunpowder
It's easy to work up an appetite as you trudge up the three floors to reach Gunpowder located at Hauz Khas Village. It's worth the effort though, as you get to sample some rare South Indian dishes seldom available anywhere else in town. Started three years ago, it is perhaps one of the few restaurants that has ditched the formula of the idli-dosa-sambhar meal and promises an authentic South Indian experience that is easy on the pocket too. The interiors at this 35 cover restaurant are basic--plastic chairs and walls with huge black ancient switchboards. You can also grab a table outside if you want a view of the Hauz Khas Lake. The place does not yet have a liquor licence so order a buttermilk or fresh lime to go with your meal. It's best to go in for a traditional Kerala meal here--so go for some kootu paratha, the quintessential Kerala roadside snack, made from shredded parathas seasoned with egg, chicken or mutton, the toddy shop meen curry, the quintessential Kerala fish curry with grated coconut and a souring agent of fish tamarind and avail--English vegetables cooked in grated coconut and yoghurt. Die-hard carnivores should not miss their buff fry, cooked with curry leaves, coconut and shallots. You could finish off your meal with some Kerala payasam or kheer.

Le Cirque
Coming to us all the way from New York, serving arguably the best European food in town, one year old Le Cirque has already won itself an impressive number of loyalists. Unlike its parent restaurant in New York which was adorned with monkeys, tents and circus balls, the Indian version is an extremely sophisticated, plush, fine dining space, catering to the crème de la crème of Delhi. The restaurant features three private dining rooms including a Chef's Table where you can relish tempting delicacies straight from the chef's kitchen, a show kitchen and separate bar areas. Start your meal with one of their crowd pleasers--the tuna tartar with spiced mango and fennel dressing, perfect to get those digestive juices flowing. Follow that with a Fondant scamorza, a twice cooked ball of cheese that is softened to a consistency that literally dissolves on your tongue. Main course is a no-brainer--it's got to be their Wagyu steak served with foie gras, truffles, potato rossini and creamed spinach. Full of rich flavours, delicious ingredients and impeccable pairings, this one is a runaway hit. Vegetarians would do well to order the morel risotto--smoky, rich, creamy and sumptuous, the dish is a delight. Don't leave without trying their signature dessert, Floating Island. A visual treat, it comes on a bed of dry ice and is a combination of meringues floating in a bowl of crème anglaise.

Chor Bizzare
Take a trip back in time to the swinging sixties at Chor Bizarre. Located at the Broadway Hotel, Daryaganj, its rustic ambience and quality food have made many a Delhiite return to this quirky diner, whose sister branch is set up along similar lines and located in London. The décor here includes a versatile collection of antiques from across the country. The age old jalopy located in the middle of the floor, which is now used as a platter for the buffet starters is bound to grab your attention as soon as you enter. The food lives up to every expectation, with equal choices for vegetarians and non vegetarians. We suggest you try the Palak patta chaat, a mildly spicy special

Banarasi chaat made of spinach. Dishes like the goshtaba (meatballs served in a white gravy) take 12 hours to prepare and regulars at the restaurant swear by its authenticity. Serving mostly Wazwan (Kashmiri cuisine), Chor Bizarre is probably one of the best in this genre. The Wazwan banquet is a fine example of this. The banquet, with nine mild dishes served on a bed of rice, includes tabak maaz, roganjosh, murg roghini, haaq, rajma, mooli akhrot ki chutney and laal payaaz. An ideal way to end a sumptuous meal here is with the flavoured Kashmiri tea, kehwa.

Not the place for queasy vegetarians, this fine dining restaurant is a carnivore's delight. Even their salad bar is less about leafy greens and more about sliced parma ham and slivers of smoked salmon. Done up in warm shades of wood with faux fires, boasting of friendly, impeccable service, it's a great place to celebrate an occasion. Though they have an à la carte menu as well as a vegetarian one, we strongly recommend their non vegetarian set menu instead, which consists of eleven kinds of barbequed and roasted meats. Following the concept of Churrascaria, made popular by old Brazilian roadside joints catering to hungry travellers, the chef comes up to your table with enormous skewers, fresh off the grill, packed with meat. Dessert is a wonderfully char grilled pineapple eaten with little balls of vanilla ice cream covered with chocolate.
