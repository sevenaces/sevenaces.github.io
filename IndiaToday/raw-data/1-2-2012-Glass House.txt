ANOTHER SON RISES
igvijaya Singh's son Jaivardhana will soon be taking his first political steps. Of course, dutifully following another political dynast Rahul Gandhi. He has planned a week-long 150-km padyatra in Raghogarh, which is his dad's constituency in Madhya Pradesh. He will dine with Dalits and also do sleepovers with tribals. Although he joined Youth Congress last August, the 24-year-old Jaivardhana is currently doing an MBA in rural development at Columbia University, New York. By the time he graduates, Rahul may have figured out his life's purpose.

OOPS, THEY SAID IT
Supreme commander of the armed forces, Pratibha Patil, pronounces IAF chief's name `Nack Brownie' (it's N.A.K. Browne). New slogan for UP tweeted by Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh: Hathi ho ya kamal ho cycle ya koi aur. Panje ka khauf aisa chale na kisi ka zor. That's a tough line, with bad poetry to boot. Mani Shankar Aiyar: I am fed up of Team Anna. They should now shut up and go back to flogging drunkards.

NO KICK START

T

he Prime Minister's Office (PMO) was supposed to get a new look after the appointment of Pulok Chatterjee as principal secretary. No such luck. B.V.R. Subrahmanyam, who served as Manmohan Singh's private secretary in UPA 1, is set to return from a three-year stint at the World Bank as joint secretary, PMO. The 1978-batch IAS officer Javed Usmani who was joint secretary, PMO, in UPA 1, and who served as senior advisor to Chatterjee when the latter was India's executive director at the World Bank, also in Washington, may be brought back as secretary.

T

he Government is doing its best to give Commerce Secretary Rahul Khullar a kick upstairs by posting him as India's ambassador to the European Union in Brussels. The 1975 batch IAS officer, who still has 15 months to retire, has no interest in a foreign posting. Vested interests are, however, determined to push the straight-talking Khullar out of Udyog Bhavan.

OPERATION LOYALIST
It has taken a mere five years after defecting from the BJP for Goa Chief Minister Digambar Kamat to become a true Congressman. In a full-page advertisement in leading newspapers on December 19, the 50th anniversary of the state's liberation from the Portuguese, Kamat launched Operation Equal Opportunity Loyalist. He thanked Jawaharlal Nehru for Operation Vijay, Indira Gandhi for allowing an opinion poll to decide whether Goa should be merged with Maharashtra and Rajiv Gandhi for granting statehood to the region. So, he missed out on Ram Manohar Lohia, who launched a movement for Goa's liberation in 1946 from Margao.

Had Kapil Sibal drafted the Food Security Bill, all foodgrain would have cost Rs 0. Both Anna and Amma (Jayalalithaa) are angry with the Congress. One for the Lokpal, the other for the Food Security Bill.

LAUGHTER CHALLENGE

APPEASING THE GODS
fter trying all sorts of politicking and emotional blackmail, tainted former Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa has turned to the option that he trusts the most--appeasing the Gods. Yeddyurappa, along with his confidante and companion, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Shobha Karandlaje, held a Vajapeya Somayagna, a havan that seeks power from the gods at Kalladaka, in Dakshina Kannada district. Yeddyurappa, who managed to save his seat five times from revolts, ascribed his success to the visits he paid to the Vaishnodevi shrine. But after the Lokayukta report that indicted him for taking bribes from the mining sector, even Vaishnodevi could not save him. Yeddyurappa visited Taliperumba temple in Kerala once, for divine intervention from internal revolts.

ajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot doesn't have much to laugh about these days so when he did, it made headlines in Jaipur newspapers. On December 19, he doubled up in laughter while watching comedian Khyali Saharan's performance at a function organised by the students' union of Rajasthan University's law college. Hmmm. Wonder for how long, now that the Bhanwri Devi case is nearing conclusion.

CHRISTMAS CHEER
JP leader Arun Jaitley has sent out invitations for a Christmas lunch at his official home, 9 Ashoka Road, three days before his birthday. Others have beaten him to the festive cheer:

Salman Khurshid The Union Law Minister rang in
the party's festive season. And what was on the menu? Kebabs, wine, Christmas cake, and even cold turkey, which some would say is a fitting meal for all Congressmen these days.

Madhu Goud Yaskhi The Congress MP used his
birthday at his sprawling Lodi Estate home as an excuse to serve Andhra food and Telangana propaganda to his guests.

Rajiv Pratap Rudy The spokesman showed
the BJP can party as well as the Congress with lunch at a five-star hotel. This time it was for a new cause: Save the tiger. Shows even the Opposition can roar.

NOT SPORTY
Ajay Maken has managed to make powerful enemies within his own party, Congress, with the National Sports Development Bill. But even the BJP is not amused. The chief ministers of Himachal Pradesh, Prem Kumar Dhumal, and Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, wrote to the Prime Minister saying the Centre cannot legislate for state sport federations.
