BACK FROM OBLIVION
Just when we had all but forgotten about her, Antara Mali, 33, decided to join the growing ranks of new celebrity mothers, after giving birth to a baby girl on May 1. Ram Gopal Varma's one-time muse has been maintaining a low profile ever since her marriage to magazine editor Che Kurien, in 2009. She resurfaced briefly in 2010 with a tonsured head for Amol Palekar's And Once Again. Will she slip back into oblivion again?

Two years after giving birth to son Azaan, she is expecting her second child with husband Shakeel Ladak, who is a builder by profession. There isn't much to be said about her film career. Motherhood does suit her way better.

Q& "My films are unapologetic A about showing intimacy"
With an opening of Rs 8.5 crore, Jannat 2 is on safe ground and the relief is quite apparent in the "Kutti Kamini Cheez's" voice. Even a star of the masses like Emraan Hashmi, 33, wakes up with cold feet on opening Fridays and doesn't look forward to the day the crowds fail to turn up. For now, he has nothing to fear. Hashmi speaks to INDIA TODAY. Q. For once it's your relationship with another man that is in focus in Jannat 2. How does it feel? A. The informer-police relationship fascinated the writers. The cat and mouse game with Sonu Dilli trying to outdo the cop and the cop trying to make him do his work was very interesting. I liked that. Q. Why are kissing and sex scenes almost mandatory in your films? A. My films have a bold interpretation. They are unapologetic about showing intimacy. Going by the number of people who come to watch my films, this is what our target audience yearns for. Q. There's a kissing scene between Kalki Koechlin and Prosenjit Chatterjee in your forthcoming film, Shanghai? Why are you missing? A. I am glad I am not part of it. I play a small-town man who suffers from an inferiority complex. Q. What kind of films would you like to do now? A. It should be different. If safe-trade pundits say something is risky, I would like to do that.
