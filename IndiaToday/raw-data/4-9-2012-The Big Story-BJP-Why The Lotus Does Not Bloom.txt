BJP

``

The politics of twentyfirst century is the politics of development and progress. With good leadership and matching vision, we can change the socio-economic situation of the country.

`` ``

We have many capable leaders who can be prime ministerial candidates. Modi is one of them.

We are committed to the idea of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. But we are not going to politicise the issue.

itin Gadkari is flying away from the city of conspiracies. Airborne, the BJP president, a master of straight talk in a party of triangulating veterans, enjoys the freedom of being himself, and the anticipation of Mumbai, a city he loves, makes his spirits lighter. Enjoying Air India's soggy croissant with Amul butter, and never forgetting to commiserate with the stewardess who has been denied salary for seven months ("Ah, Praful Patel ruined it!"), he may ideally prefer not to be

gling to catch up with the president. When in desperation, the BJP's first instinct is to shop in the disputed sites of mythology for a slogan. It may have worked in the Nineties, when the BJP reached the peak in its struggle against power, when the anger of the political Hindu was a nationalist party's most effective weapon of mass mobilisation, and when a displaced god was an ace vote gatherer. India has travelled a long distance from Ayodhya, and for a new generation, the temples are elsewhere in the marketplace of aspirations. Politics itself has changed: the age of ideology has already been replaced by an era of ideas. What's the Big Idea of the BJP? Even a straight-talking Gadkari has to do a bit of circumlocution here. "We need ideas, of course, innovative ideas, but on the basis of ideology," he says. Ideas like? "Ideas on rural development, agricultural reform, employment, and alternative energy like bio fuel..." "These ideas will win you an election?"

reminded of the party stuck in a morass far below. As if the very mention of the BJP awakens his craving for spice, he asks the air hostess whether he can get some pickle to make his breakfast a bit more appetising. In vain. He abandons breakfast, and thinks of the next best thing that can make this morning fulfilling: How to turn BJP into a natural party of governance. "The politics of twenty-first century is the politics of development and progress. With good leadership and matching vision, we can change the socio-economic situation of the country," says the man who has been chosen to regain the India BJP lost eight years ago. And then comes the qualifier: "Ambitious politics is not part of the BJP."

Ask Gadkari whether politicians should retire at some stage and he will say nothing more than "every individual should think about it and take a decision" .
Congress led by an ailing, and increasingly invisible, Sonia Gandhi; a failed princeling who has no right to be there but for his surname; and an India waiting for an alternative. The BJP does not have the text. Gadkari thinks he has one. "It is the politics for making this country stronger. I can only think of the nation first; the party comes second; and the individual leader third. A lot can be done for the growth of India as an industrial powerhouse. Take power, for instance. If the environment ministry is going to stop all hydroelectric projects, how can we develop? In the aftermath of the 2G scandal, an impression has been created that all businessmen are criminals. Then there are the benefits of private-public partnership, which the Government is least interested in taking advantage of. In road, power, railways, aviation and tourism, you can increase the capital investment ten times by such partnership. The growth rate is slowing down and the Government is not creating the right atmosphere for development. Somewhere the licence raj still exists. We will change that." Ask him about the party and Gadkari talks about the country, as if he has a clearer vision for the renewal of India than for the BJP. As one of the few politicians who has created real jobs rather than merely alloted reservations (his Purti Group of companies, worth Rs 600 crore, employs around 10,000 people in Maharashtra) before setting off to lead a party, he thinks he is entitled to make development the grammar of his argument. The party, though, is strug-

he words fit the man. Ambition is one word that recurs in his vocabulary of change as a synonym for sin. It's one temptation, he keeps repeating, he has successfully managed to resist. He portrays himself as a leader with a difference, an entrepreneur who wants to use his managerial skills to set the dilapidated House of Saffron in order. "Presently the party needs someone who can give everything to the party. Ambitious politicians are not good for the party," he explains, and the explanation is open to further translation, which is left to the listener. The post-2004 story of BJP is a narrative of defeatism, populated by leaders whose ambition has pitted one against the other, with some of them not even realising their own redundancy. The party has an embarrassment of riches in leaders, but it does not have one galvanising face. At a time when there is a groundswell of anti-Establishment sentiment in the country, the BJP does not have the ideas or attitude to seize the moment. The Uttar Pradesh verdict was as devastating for the BJP as it was for the Congress. The context is ideal: A discredited UPA Government headed by a prime minister who is not in power but only in office, that too at the mercy of belligerent allies; a badly battered

"Good governance and development. That's it. The progress of the last man in society--that's what I want." "You have a brains trust that is working on these ideas?" "More than 200 people, intellectuals and academics, are working on a vision document called India 2025." "And what's the ideology you say you can't abandon?" "Cultural nationalism is our inspiration. It is our motivation. We are for modernisation but not for westernisation. We don't want to copy any foreign country." "What's wrong if some good ideas are western? Do you think this will appeal to India's youth?" "We need Western technology, but we also need a value-based social culture." "But how can a political party impose values?" "We won't impose. We will propagate. We need a generation that is progressive but rooted in our values. We have to interpret our values from the past, though I am not saying old is gold. We have to take the best, and discard the worst, like the caste system. Remember, religion is not just dharma.

His detractors see the emergence of a new power axis, the Gadkari-Jaitley combination, much to the discomfort of Sushma, Modi and the lonely Advani.

And Hindutva means good governance, development, progress and tolerance. Cultural nationalism is a way of life." Gadkari finds no conflict between Hindutva and the aspirations of twenty-first century Indian youth. For him, the fault lies with an education system that can produce good scientists but not good citizens with a social and moral vision. "Family values, social

consciousness and national commitment are as important as a modern approach to development," he says. Is it a politician's job to teach moral values? "Parties are not for just gaining power. As a mass party, BJP has to change the attitude of the people as well as the leaders. We need to motivate them with an ideology that makes them agents of change. A career-oriented generation is not going to solve our problem. What we need is a commitment to nation." Does the party leader sound more like a leader of the nation? Gadkari has heard this before: the possibility of him being the dark horse. "I'm talking from the core of my heart. I have decided to spend my life for the country. I'm not working for any post." What's wrong about being in power? Won't you be then better placed to play out your development politics? "I can

be a kingmaker also," he answers. Why can't you be the king? The could-be-dark horse wards off the question with a big laugh. Somehow, he thinks a prime ministerial candidate won't be such a big issue for the party. "There will be an appropriate leader at the appropriate time. This is not the time to decide on the leader." Will there be one before the elections? "I don't know. But choosing a leader won't be a big problem, I can tell you." But there is one leader who is getting a lot of attention, nationally as well as internationally, though the party is not sure whether he is an asset or a problem--or both. Gadkari knows who it is. Narendra Modi not only dominates the popularity charts as the party's most desirable prime ministerial candidate.

He has even become a Time cover boy. "We have got many capable leaders of prime ministerial potential. Narendra Modi is one of them. His track record in Gujarat is excellent. He is a role model for the country." Who are the others? "Advaniji, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Rajnath Singh, Murli Manohar Joshi.....All are good." "Advani? Joshi? Are you being diplomatic?" "I'll accept that." Modi, though, is unlikely to accept the ignominy of being denied his uniqueness, his exceptionalism as the most popular action hero of the Right. When Modi looks at himself, he sees a leader larger than his party, and larger than Gujarat. This self-portrait continues to be bought by those who are

mesmerised by his stupendous achievement as the administrator of India's fastest growing state, and their legion is rising. He is also angry, and bitter. The anger has aggravated his arrogance, which in turn has alienated his friends within the party. He inspires as well as intimidates, especially the potential allies. Force Modi galvanises as well as polarises. Nitish Kumar, BJP's most secular friend and a rising hero in the politics of development, has already made Modi an unwelcome campaigner in Bihar. What Modi wants is India 2014, and Gadkari won't say whether that is what the BJP wants. Modi sees himself as the only candidate who has the credentials to

be the bridge between modernisation and tradition--the most marketfriendly Hindu nationalist. Suddenly there is someone else who fits the bill: Gadkari himself. The entrepreneur from Nagpur swears by the lofty ideals of the RSS, the organisation that has shaped his idea of the nation. "The RSS does not impose anything on the party. The times have changed, and so has RSS." Then he hastily adds: "The letter may change; the spirit won't. The core ideology can't." He finds no conflict between his adherence to the sanctity of Hindutva and his passion for development. That is why his detractors see the emergence of a new power axis in the Parivar--the Nitin Gadkari-Arun Jaitley combination--much to the discomfort of the sulking Modi, the isolated Sushma and even the lonely Advani, the patriarch who refuses to wither away. If Jaitley is an aspirational Vajpayee, an association with Gadkari provides him the necessary Hindutva legitimacy. Ask Gadkari whether politicians should retire at some stage and he will say nothing more than "every individual should think about it and take a decision on retirement". That is bold enough, even

if he is deliberately vague. "And yes, we need a modern face to lead the India of the twenty-first century." What concentrates his mind now is not senescence but indiscipline. "The party has authorised some leaders to speak to the media. But there are many leaders speaking to the media without any reason. That is indiscipline. This kind of loose talk is damaging the image of the party and we have to stop this." That too at a time when he thinks the party needs a makeover in public perception. The party will overcome Karnataka, he says, and he won't call B.S. Yeddyurappa corrupt because the court has already absolved him. "The party will be united

and win the elections in Karnataka," he says, though he doesn't want to speculate on Yeddyurappa. He is more bothered about the image of the party than that of the stigmatised former chief minister. "The Congress has created the false image that we are antiminority. We are not. I'm against the politics of caste and communities. Justice to all and appeasement to none--that is my motto." At 55, Gadkari knows that time is on his side. By his own admission, he is an outsider in the whirl of Delhi cesspools. "I have to work silently. I can't afford to upset anybody." He is aware BJP is not behaving like a natural party of governance. It sees itself as an alternative to the Congress, nothing more, and its responses are always reactive, never proactive. "We have to change to regain the space that belongs to us. The process is slow and I have to make it faster. My speed is increasing by the day." The could-bedark horse is galloping against time. He has to keep pace with a changing India--and be wary of the warhorses from the same saffron stable.
