GLOSSARY OUT OF THE CLOSET

ZINTA

Preity Zinta has either become extremely comfortable with herself, or she thought she would find a comfortable spot and curl up for a nap when she reached the Ambani home. Why else would she turn up for a party in her nightwear and her hair in a mess? Next time leave the strapless overallsmeets-floral pajamas disaster for a sleepover with the girls. Genelia D'Souza was a pretty sight as usual in an embroidered white anarkali, with a dazzling smile to match. And while we are glad she looks happily married, does she really need to flash her pearlies like it's her wedding reception all over again, especially when hubby Riteish Deshmukh looks dazed at best? Please put the flashlights away.
YOGEN SHAH

Priyanka Chopra seems to have forgotten that the party wasn't about her as she preened in a nude Dolce & Gabbana dress. We hear she has been getting cold shoulders around town. Is that why she was warming up to the cameras instead?

BAPPAAND TANEESHA

WEDDING BLISS
After the success of his song Oh La la, music director Bappi Lahiri has another reason to celebrate. His son Bappa Lahiri, 28, also a music composer, will tie the knot in April. The young Lahiri will marry Taneesha Verma, 24, his girlfriend of two years. The couple was introduced by common friends in Mumbai. The wedding will be held at Mumbai's ITC Grand Maratha on April 16. Senior Lahiri will host a party for his Kolkata film industry friends later this year.

Gujarati cinema finally comes out of the closet. K.R. Devmani, a former Ayurvedic doctor from Ahmedabad, has turned director with Meghadhanushya--The Colour of Life. The film is about the challenges faced by a man while openly accepting his homosexuality, and has gay rights champion Manvendra Singh Gohil as its narrator. It serves a dual purpose-- highlighting the problems faced by homosexuals and drawing attention to cinema in the region. "After the 1990s, most of the urban society audience parted ways with Gujarati films and till date, they have not returned," laments the director.

Virat Kohli made an earnest effort to suit up, especially when teammate Harbhajan Singh came in a shirt and fielding coach Jonty Rhodes in his day wear. Perhaps a less shiny suit next time though?

GOING PLACES
Kaminey being the lone bright spot in his Bollywood career so far, Chandan Roy Sanyal, 32, is hesitant to talk about his potential next big break-- Aamir Khan's Kashmiri Glasshouse with debutant director Deepak Dwivedi. He has two films, besides Deepa Mehta's Midnight's Children, up for release later this year. There's Ashish Shukla's psychological thriller-love story Prague and Aditya Bhattacharya's underworld film Bombay's Most Wanted with Tannishtha Chatterjee. Busy man.

MISSING IN ACTION
It was party time for Indian cricket. Celebrating his 100th ODI century was Sachin Tendulkar, 38, at Nita and Mukesh Ambani's mansion Antilla. Following his retirement Rahul Dravid, 39, was felicitated by the BCCI. Both cricketers missed each other's party. The Wall wasn't on Antilla's guest list and the master blaster flew off to London and missed the ceremony. We hope it was just a coincidence.

TEAMWORK AT ITS BEST
7 Khoon Maaf had Naseeruddin Shah, 61, and his son Vivaan, 22, but not together. They will finally share screen space in first-time director Rocky Khanna's Mastaan. The Mumbai underworld flick will be a `detailed' one after Khanna's two-year-long research. Vivaan may also be pairing up with Udaan actor Rajat Bharmecha, 22, and a pig for Sajit Warrier's Disco Valley--a mad and crazy youth comedy about an end-of-the-world party. It will be shot in Fiji. Interesting times ahead.

He was behind the camera in popular TV shows and films such as World This Week, Aamir and MTV Coke Studio, India. Now, Supavitra Babul, 40, is making his Bollywood debut as a writer and director with Bittoo Boss. Releasing on April 13, it is partly based on Babul's encounters at blingy Punjabi weddings as a cameraman. A self-taught cameraperson, Babul started working in news TV after college. "I want to tell a thousand stories through my lens," he says.

Paris Hilton, 31, has a new India fascination after launching her handbag and accessories line in Mumbai last year. Her welcome party in September 2011 may not have been as starstudded as expected, but designer Rocky S., who draped her then, has styled her for her label's new ad campaign. Wearing a little black dress and a trench coat, she was photographed in Mumbai by fashion photographer Prasad Naik. "I loved working with such a talented crew in India," she said.
