PM-IN-WAITING
avjot Singh Sidhu has hit upon what he imagines is the perfect antidote to Narendra Modi. The Amritsar MP wants BJP chief Nitin Gadkari as prime minister. "Congress da jahaaz dub reha hai... tusi tayyar ho jao, chheti hi Nitin Gadkariji Lal Qile ton desh da jhanda lehronge (The Congress ship is sinking... prepare yourselves, Nitin Gadkari will unfurl the flag at the Red Fort very soon)," he proclaimed grandly at an election meeting on July 9 for the Assembly bypoll at Dasuya. One hopes it was not a joke.

TOTAL RECALL
atwar Singh has been a loyalist since he was the first IFS officer to be inducted in Indira Gandhi's PMO. And despite the Volcker sack, he remains committed to the Gandhis. So expect anecdotes and revelations about the first family in his soon-to-be completed autobiography, Just Passing By. Take this for instance. After Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991, Sonia Gandhi asked him who should be the next president of the Congress. Singh suggested she consult P.N. Haksar, her motherin-law's favourite political adviser. Haksar suggested Shankar Dayal Sharma. Natwar and Aruna Asaf Ali were sent to Sharma, who declined the offer. That's when the job went to P.V. Narasimha Rao.

WHO'S IN CHARGE?
he Prime Minister is yet to decide on his Number Two--the Cabinet minister who will officiate in his absence. Log on to India.gov.in, and Sharad Pawar's name is right below that of Manmohan Singh. Does that mean the next time Manmohan goes abroad on a visit, Pawar will take charge?

DEVOTED DAD-IN-LAW
hy did Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi go on a 10-day trip to the US while the state was reeling under one of the worst floods in the last 20 years? Perhaps to wish his sonin-law Prasenjit Phukan luck for his new venture. San Francisco-based Phukan, an alumnus of MIT, quit Google in March to start Shopilly, an online shopping website, along with former eBay product manager Anirban Datta. The website is the brainchild of Randy Shoup, former chief engineer of eBay.

or once, a Karnataka Chief Minister has done something to redeem the state's failing standards of public probity. Outgoing Chief Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda refused to sign files related to administration from July 5, the day he realised that he might be replaced. Gowda turned away ministerial colleagues who came to him with files for nearly a full week before he actually resigned. Smart.

THE SURNAME GAME
he Congress and dynasty have always been synonymous.The party's Karnataka unit decided to make a public acceptance of this by bringing together politically active children of all former chief ministers. Senior Congress leader B. L. Shankar organised a meeting of Dinesh Gundu Rao (R. Gundu Rao), Kumar Bangarappa (S. Bangarappa), Mahima Patel (J. H. Patel), Kailashnath Patil (Veerendra Patil), Mamata Nichani (Ramakrishna Hegde) and Ajay Singh (N. Dharam Singh) in the hope of getting more votes on the back of famous surnames in the 2013 Assembly elections. Guess they haven't learnt anything from Rahul Gandhi's cameo.

fter getting permission from special CBI judge O.P. Saini to visit his constituency, A. Raja finally spent two days in Chennai and then went to Nilgiris with supporters and former state ministers Pongalur Palanichamy and Kovai Ramachandran. On his June 10 visit, he received nearly 500 grievance petitions from people in his constituency. He spent much of the time at his Radhakrishna Road home in Chennai. When his interview to a Tamil channel Puthiya Talaimurai was aired, he watched it with the party chief M. Karunanidhi. Charming togetherness.
