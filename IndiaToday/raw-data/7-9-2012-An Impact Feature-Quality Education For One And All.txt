With a focus on improving the quality of education and active support from the community, the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in Assam is making giant strides towards providing inclusive education for all children, especially girls.

T

he fundamental right to free and compulsory education is one of the best gifts that children can receive from their nation. With universal elementary education being the goal of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), the initiative in Assam has a multi-pronged approach through its range of activities all round the year. Besides providing infrastructure facilities and improving the quality of education by introducing modern teaching methodology and innovative learning techniques, the programme is also reaching out to remote areas and out-of-school children and especially girl-children. With increased community participation, the programme has been a resounding success over the years and the multiplying number of young faces in the state's schools is the proverbial proof of the pudding.  QUALITY OF EDUCATION Since its inception in the year 2002-2003, Sarba Siksha Abhiyan, Assam has been putting its best efforts to achieve quality education through various activities in elementary schools, the entire focus being childcentric. One of the core components of SSA, the Teachers' Training Component deals with the quality of education in the schools of the state. SSA strives to ensure comprehensive development of children appropriate curriculum, teaching and learning processes and preparation of teachers through induction, refreshers' and professional training. SSA also focuses on development of values, better methods of evaluation, self-learning measures and better management for improving the quality of education. In the academic year 2011-12, SSA, Assam has conducted a range of activities at the state, district, block and cluster levels. School timings have been changed and every school must now conduct the morning assembly 15 minutes before lessons commence at 9am. Each Lower Primary (LP) school must conduct classes for 4 hrs and 45 minutes while Upper Primary (UP) schools must conduct classes for 5 hours 30 minutes in compliance with RTE Act 2009. As per the NCTE-norms, SSA, Assam conducted the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) in collaboration with the

Government of Assam at both LP and UP levels. Of the 330927 candidates who had appeared in TET, 52722 have qualified. With a view to select meritorious and qualified candidates in a transparent and impartial manner as assistant teachers in the elementary schools of Assam, SSA, Assam had invited online applications for 28,224 posts on contractual basis. A total of 50,476 applications had been received by the State Mission Office, SSA, Assam and 26,110 teachers have been finally appointed in elementary schools. With a view to introduce better teaching methodologies and lesson delivery, the government of Assam will implement a pilot project for improving English language skills among 42,840 teachers in Assam,through a collaboration effort with British Council, SSA, ELTI, SCERT, DEE and a few teachers of Kamrup district. A British Council team has conducted a baseline survey in four districts, following which the training for master trainers has been organised in a phased manner. For strengthening the efforts to improve the English language programmes in elementary education, SSA, Assam and ICICI Foundation have conducted an English language pilot programme for training teachers in English. With the help of the state government, free textbooks were distributed among all students of Class I to VIII for the Academic year 2012, at the very beginning of the year. Sarba Siksha Assam has initiated the process of free distribution of two pairs of uniforms for students of government and provincial elementary schools. All girls (18,98,497), SC boys (2,02,400), ST boys (3,01,582) and BPL boys (6,70,215) have been covered under this programme. Evaluation is an integral part of education and the process must be continuous and comprehensive. After assessing the learning gaps of the students through diagnostic evaluation, the teachers are implementing remedial teaching to fill up those gaps. The approach of child-friendly inclusive schools and systems has emerged as a holistic solution for a

comprehensive range of qjality interventions in education. UNICEF Assam and SSA, Assam are jointly implementing the Child-Friendly Schools and System (CFSS) in selected elementary schools of the state. The Learning Enhancement Programme has been innovatively carried forward through the state-level Vigyan Jagaran Yatra and Learning to Learn, an innovative programme for the tea garden community children. As part of the Vigyan Jagaran Yatra and to help children prepare for the challenges of day-to-day life, SSA, Assam organised a series of exhibition-cum-competition on models and projects in Science and Mathematics among the students of Upper Primary schools at cluster, block and district levels. The programme culminated at Srimanta Sankardev Kalakshetra where the best teams in science and mathematics as well as quiz teams from each district participated. An interactive programme with scientists and a field trip to the Science Museum at Khanapara.Guwahati were also organised. Under the Learning to Learn programme for the tea tribe children of Sonitpur district, children are encouraged to learn the regional language that is used as the medium of instruction in primary schools. The tea garden community of Assam comprises different aboriginal linguistic groups from remote areas who commonly uses Sadri or Sadani as their lingua franca. Children of the community have to adapt themselves to a new learning environment and an alien language from the first day of schooling. This initiative ensures that they are not over-burdened with language learning.  ACCESS TO EDUCATION In the 2011-12 budget, the HRD ministry approved two residential schools at Guwahati under Kamrup district and at Silchar in Cachar District. These schools are exclusively for children from small hamlets with low population and deprived children from urban areas, particularly homeless and street children without any adult protection. Since its inception, SSA, Assam has been implementing various activities of intervention to achieve the goal of providing schooling facilities to all children who are out of school. The implementation of these acts has resulted in the reduction of out-of-school children from 13,40,185 in 2002-03 to 1,24,577 inMMjyi^it-of-school children had been provided. jUritti&lBIPrt.through initiatives like Residential Bridge Course Centre (RBCC), Sanjogi Siksha Kendra (SSK), Community Coaching Programme (CCP), Upper Primary Bridge Course Centre (UPBC) and Hard to Reach Centre (HTR). After the enforcement of RTE Act 2009, these centres have been re-conceptualised as special training centres, namely Residential Special Training Centre (RSTC) and Non-Residential Special Training Centre (NRSTC). In the year 2011-12, a total of 9945 such centres have been made operational for the education of out-of-school children (see Table 1). As many as 65,893 students have come back to school or returned to mainstream education in the same year, due to the initiative of SSA, Assam (see Table 2).

at an elementary stage, a state-level study has been initiated in an attempt to get an in-depth analysis has been initiated. Since SSA intervention in the three newly created districts of Baksa, Cbirang and Udalguri has started from the current financial year, there was a need to conduct a baseline assessment survey in these districts, which is being carried out.  INNOVATION SSA, Assam started the Computer-Aided Learning programme in 2003-04 and a total of 2605 schools have been covered till 2011-12. The programme was further extended to all the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) and Residential Bridge Course Centres (RBCC) since children enrolled in these two institutions are from the weaker sections of the society. Under the project, one K-yan machine preloaded with multimedia contents for Class I-X based on NCERT syllabus, one UPS were provided to each of the selected schools. Further, generator sets have been provided to these schools to ensure back-up power. Public- Private Partnership (PPP) from five organisations provided the support to all schools covered under the programme. During the year a contingency grant of Rs 10,000 was released to each of the 1245 smart and K-yan schools, KGBVs and RBCCs. The amount was released for electricity bills for usage of computers, Internet connection, fuel in schools using generator sets, consumables like toner and educational CDs, security arrangement, electrical repairing and insurance of computers and accessories.  COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND SPECIAL FOCUS GROUP According to the RTE Rules, 2011, School Management Committees (SMC) have been constituted. Following a state government notification, SMCs of government provincialised schools have been re-constituted. SMC members were trained in block as well as cluster levels in cascade mode and training manuals were developed both at state and district levels respectively regarding responsibilities of the SMCs. While block-level training for 1,05,595 members focused on School Development Plan (SDP) and role of SMCs in respect to special training, the cluster-level training for 1,17,879 participants dealt with issues related to CWSN and social audit among others. One member from each SMC was given day-long block-level training on disaster management school plan. The State Disaster Management Authority provided support in imparting training as well as preparing a training manual. National Education Day 2011 was observed across the state on November 11 at school, district and state levels. The state-level function was graced by the Hon'ble Chief Minister and Hon'ble Education Minister of Assam. Three episodes of Pragya, a programme on RTE telecast on DD Kendra, Guwahati, focusing on success stories pertaining to elementary education were produced for showcasing to motivate and mobilise stakeholders in promoting such activities. Last year 700 public and private buses in the city of Guwahati and 758 public and private buses plying in the rural areas were involved for mass media campaign on RTE. These buses have colourful images and catchy slogans carrying the message of Right to Education for all. A toll-free number (1800-345-3525) has been made operational under SSA, Assam to address the queries, grievances or issues of TET. The Utsav Vidyarambha programme was conducted in all elementary schools of the state between January 1 and 3,2012. Under this programme, the school campus was cleaned in the morning followed by illuminating lamps in the school building. This was followed by the enrolment of newcomers in the school for the new academic session and handing over the free textbooks. A procession with the motto 'No Out-OfSchool Children' in school catchment areas was organised followed by the formation of student government and mothers group for the session.

[ INCLUSIVE EDUCATION Stressing on the fundamental right of all children to free and compulsory education, SSA, Assam provides an ideal response to the demand for quality basic education across the country. However, universal elementary education cannot be achieved unless children with special needs are also provided access to quality education. Hence, the education of Children with Special Needs (CWSN) is an essential part of the SSA framework. Under the Right to Education Act 2009, the state government and SSA, Assam, have adopted various strategies to provide quality education and other basic facilities for children in the age group of 6-14 years. SSA plans to ensure that every child with special needs is provided education in an appropriate and inclusive environment and adopt a zero-rejection policy so that no child is left out of the education system. Suitable model plans for new school buildings, additional class rooms and girls' toilets have been developed based on specific areas like plains, riverine or flood-prone areas or urban regions with land constraints. Provisions for child-friendly elements were incorporated in the estimates of buildings. Along with the new construction, ramps at slope 1:12 have been provided for easy approach of the students including the CWSN. Details of infrastructure with allied information in the districts have been collected of schools and habitation mapping has already been completed. An asset register is maintained for updating the assets created out of SSA fund along with relevant information. The process of school environment assessment is also being carried out. In most of the rural and backward areas, new construction in school has helped develop a sense of ownership among the School Management Committee (SMC) members along with increased awareness about the rules and procedures. With the growing number of attractive school buildings, the enrolment figures have also considerably increased. People consider the school building constructed under SSA, Assam as the only shining asset in most villages. Annual school grant, maintenance grant and grants for teachers for Teaching Learning Material are released to the school management committees of all concerned schools through bank transfer directly from State Mission Office. While LP schools receive Rs 5,000 each as infrastructure grant, UP schools are entitled to Rs 7,000. Schools with up to three classrooms get Rs 5,000 for maintenance while schools with more than three classrooms receive Rs 10,000 each. Every teacher is entitled to a grant of Rs 500 under this schemes.  RESEARCH AND EVALUATION A several state-level research studies have been initiated under this programme. Realising the significance of the issue of dropouts from school

 EDUCATION OF GIRLS Education of girls has been one of the top priorities of the Government of India. Reaching out to the girl child is central to the efforts to universalise elementary education. SSA, the national flagship programme for Universalisation of Elementary Education (UEE), recognises the need for special efforts to bring out-of-school girls, especially from disadvantaged groups, to the school. SSA, Assam has undertaken a host of strategies for bringing all girl-children under the fold of elementary education. In Assam, there are girl-children who are deprived from educational opportunities due to lack of awareness of guardians, teachers, confidence of girl-children, motivation and courage. SSA, Assam has designed a number of activities like training, awareness and mobilisation programmes to minimise the problems faced by girl-children and generate a community demand for the education of girls. Among the activities undertaken for promoting girls' education are life-skill development programmes like development of personality and reasoning capacity as well as adolescent health and challenges of the girl-child etc. Such activities were organised by Assam Manila Samata Society (AMSS) in Dhemaji, Udalguri andTindukia districts for girls in the age group of 11-14 years. A self-defence training programme was implemented in 20-25 target schools, 37 KGBVs and 98 model cluster schools under the National Programme of Education for Girls at Elementary Level (NPEGEL) scheme, Residential Bridge Course Centres for girls under alternative and innovative component along with girl-children of schools in special focus group for six months between August 2011 and January 2012. A total of 14,696 girls were covered in all 26 districts of Assam. A two-day sensitisation workshop on girls' education was organised for 100 teachers of UP-level schools in each of the 26 districts. During the workshop, the teachers sensitized on issues like out-of-school girls, gender gap in literacy, rural female literacy and percentage of female teachers in the elementary level. With an aim to abolish gender discrimination to improve the educational status of girl-children, the AMSS has organised training programmes on gender awareness in Udalguri, Dhemaji and Tinsukia districts for parents, village education committees and teachers of the clusters. In Darrang, Udalguri, Tinsukia, Baska, Karbi Anglong, Dima Hasao, Dibrugarh and Sibsagar districts, there are many girls who were over-aged dropouts and who have never enrolled in schools. Vocational training progammes on cycle-repairing, knitting, flower-making, tube-well repairing, bamboo basket-making and candle-making were organised for them. The AMSS organised Kishori Mela, an annual convention for 454 girls in four programmes with various sports and art competitions in Udalguri, Dhemaji and Tinsukia districts. An award of Rs 5000 in kind was given to the best school of the cluster, which served to motivate the teachers and students. The AMSS also organised three educational tours for girl-children of UPlevel schools to Guwahati (planetarium and science museum) to provide the children a first-hand experience on scientific subjects. A motivational programme against child marriage and unscientific beliefs was also organised. Tea gardens and areas inhabited by SC/ST and minority communities were selected and 20-30 spots were identified to con programmes like street theatre and open meetings among others  KASTURBA GANDHI BALIKA VIDYALAYA With an aim to provide quality elementary and life-skill educational facilities to girl-children in the age group of 10-14 years belonging to SC, ST, OBC and minority communities, the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) scheme has helped establish residential schools and hostel facilities for girls in the educationally backward blocks (EBBs), towns and minority concentrated areas all over the country. These schools are set up in blocks that have rural female literacy below the national average, gender gap in literacy more than the national average and minority population above 20 per cent. In Assam, 37 KGBVs (three model-l with 100 children each and 34 Model-ll with 50 children each) are operational in 37 blocks covering 2000 UP-level girl-children. In 2011-12, 20 KGBVs approved covering 1000 girl-children and classes have started from April 2012. Teachers of KGBVs were imparted training in the programme conducted for the formal school teachers at the block level. A five-day training module involving the Don Bosco Institute, Guwahati was organised for empowering the teachers with updated knowledge, classroom techniques, teaching skills and sense of commitment. In the programme, 200 teachers were imparted training in four phases on areas like inputs on 21st century skills for personal and professional development, classroom management techniques, instructional strategies to improve students' achievement, hands-on experience in lesson designing and practice teaching and exposure trips to science centres and planetariums. During the 2011-12 academic session, 379 children from 26 KGBVs passed the class VIII exam and were absorbed into mainstream education in Class IX of the nearest secondary school. Children at two KGBVs at Amri block in Karbi Anglong district and at Birsingjarua block in Dhubri district had to face difficulties since there is no provision of electricity in these areas. Following approvals from the Assam Energy Development Agency under the Science and Technology Department of the Government of Assam, solar electrification has been installed in both the KGBVs. Necessary items for vocational training like sewing machines, weaving looms, embroidery sets, printing screen and other accessories were supplied to the KGBVs. Part-time instructors were engaged to train children in vocational activities like stitching and tailoring, knitting, weaving, screen printing, embroidery, doll-making and flower-making. Children in KGBVs were imparted self-defense training for building discipline, courage, confidence and empowerment. With the help of the community, the children have also participated in various co-curricular and recreational activities like music, dance, drama and yoga.
