THE OLYMPIC STADIUM IN OLYMPIC PARK, LONDON

REBORN IN LONDON
By Prachi Bhuchar

Site of the 2012 Summer Olympics, London's East End is where art, music and dance find a happy mix
signs that point you in the direction of the metal-and-steel Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park which is a 10-minute lonely walk through whiplashing rain or drops of sunshine, depending on your luck. If you take the bus instead of the tube, as you cross Tower Bridge into the east end, the gloss that London dons so readily dulls and the buildings start to look humbler, the shops representing diverse ethnic groups. It really does feel like another city, and for the last century, people in this part of London have worn the `outcast' tag without a fight. The smog has long lifted but the shadow of poverty, oppression and distrust still slings low on the horizon of this once-industrial wasteland. The original breadbasket of London, with its fertile agricultural fields by the Lea made way for industrialisation, characterised by factories, smoke, chemical plants and machinery. So began East London's long and oft-hackneyed association with squalor. During World War I, it was razed, but even decades later, the low-cost shanties bear a dazed look. An area that has been caricatured in shrewd novels by Martin Amis and George Orwell, it was best known for its association with the notorious Jack the Ripper who lived here--a myth now exploited by tourist-friendly walks. For those who call this home, the graffiti and grit are very real. The open skies and low-income housing is the only London they have ever known. Despite the dark history, East End has risen to the Olympic challenge since 2005 when London nicked Paris to win the Games bid; this was after all the only direction the city could grow in. Since then, approximately £7.3 billion (Rs 72,780 crore) has poured into the five Olympic boroughs of Newham, Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Greenwich and Waltham Forest for `sustainable gentrification'. While most acknowledge that all efforts (and investment)

here's a nervous twitch in the pale sky as London's Olympic destiny waits to be decided in less than a week. As the Jubilee line train stops at its final destination, Stratford, streams of people emerge from the metal, eager to sink into revitalised East London. As you walk out of the station, you find yourself in the newly minted Westfield mall; small groups of Olympic volunteers wear bright tees and carry a tall plastic sign (called a lollipop) announcing their readiness to help; there are ready

have been focused on making this area respectable, there are still some worrying issues. Irish, Jews, Bangladeshis, and later, East Europeans, who made East End their refuge in the early 1960s, did so because they could not afford any better, and a home here ensured that they remained an invisible part of London without paying a steep price for it. For them, the transformation from marshland and the algaenumb River Lea to an area fitted with gleaming edifices, homogenised shopping centres and an extended culture club has been a welcome but overwhelming, decade-long process.

They have seen the skyline change west of Stratford as the Olympic stadium rose over 740 acres of polluted low-value field land. There have been other changes as well. The Stratford station, which was till recently considered unsafe, will now be the entry point for millions of visitors who make their way to the Olympics, starting July 27. It will also serve as a stopping point for trains on the high-speed London-toParis Eurostar line. The 2.5 sq km Olympic Park will also have close to 28,000 new homes, many of which will later be converted to usable,

low-cost housing for locals. The site will also house the largest urban park Britain has seen, with 3,00,000 wetland plants, 2,000 trees and five miles of Lea which has been restored to its former glory. "London's Olympics bid was predicated on the regeneration of this swathe because it has some of the highest deprivation levels in the country. Our strategy to ensure a legacy was the key consideration of the design and build of the Olympic Park," says Peter Tudor, director of venues for London Legacy Development Corporation. Over 2 million tonnes of polluted

soil was cleaned and reused to transform the marsh into a green oasis. Low-carbon concrete from industrial waste and surplus gas pipes were used to build the 80,000-seater stadium which claims to be a model of green construction. Sir Alan Collins, managing director of United Kingdom Trade & Investment, the Olympic Legacy Programme, says, "We are looking at what will be left behind in London when the torch goes out." There are plans to convert the stadium for use by a professional soccer team, and residents are hopeful the fancy Zaha Hadid-designed aquatics

centre will become a community pool. While the focus over the last seven years has been on the construction, debris and impending Olympic legacy, East London has been busy developing its own, distinct sub-culture. No one can pinpoint when the east went from nondescript to avant-garde but today, its creative soul has attracted stars like Ralph Fiennes and Keira Knightley to make it their home, lending it respectability. From regular music festivals to experimental multicultural chefs, kitschy galleries, design and art unlimited, the East End is brimming with raw, gritty energy

that makes the rest of London look staid in comparison. During the day, shoppers in search of that `out there' piece trawl its boutique stores; by night, clubbers descend to claim the streets and new party venues. The curtain will come down on the Olympics over the next few weeks but the new voice that East End has found is only growing stronger, and that, along with the infrastructure legacy that the Games are likely to leave behind, will go a long way in cementing its personality as a New York-esque East Village that's happy to draw multiple ethnic groups into its fold.
