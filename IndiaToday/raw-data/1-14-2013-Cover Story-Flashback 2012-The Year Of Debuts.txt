WOMEN
WHO RULE

VIDYA BALAN IN KAHAANI (1) proved she could carry a film on her own, and that The Dirty Picture and No One Killed Jessica were no flukes. SRIDEVI IN ENGLISH VINGLISH (2) showed what we had been missing for the 15 years she was away from the big screen. She sparkled in the role of a simple homemaker who struggled with English.

KAREENA KAPOOR stayed on top even though Heroine and Agent Vinod went under. Her act in Talaash reminded us why.
