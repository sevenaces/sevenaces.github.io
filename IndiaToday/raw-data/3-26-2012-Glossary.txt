EASY, BREEZY FASHION
As summer descends upon us, Bollywood beauties trade layers for flowing gowns. Now it's for us to get back in shape to fit into them.
Suzanne Roshan The wife of Bollywood's resident Greek god opts for a psychedelic print in black and white. Gold accessories do make the outfit more dressy. But perhaps the look would have been more summer-friendly with shoes and jewellery in fun colours. Malaika Arora-Khan She's wearing a floorlength dress with no neckline plunging till there and no slit up to there. That is enough to shock us into silence. The bright colours and horizontal stripes are the only things vying for attention here. Deepika Padukone The leggy lass has the perfect body and height to pull off an ankle-length gown. That is probably the reason why she favours it. The traditional embroidery on the one she's wearing makes it different from the usual backless ones she dons.

He is popular as the silly guy in the Sprite advertisements and Imran Khan's friend Kunal in I Hate Love Storys. But now actor Kavin Dave, 27, will soon have a lead role to his credit. He plays a photojournalist Suresh Sudhakar a.k.a. Susu, in a comedy titled Bumboo. Based on the French film L'Emmerdeur, it has been directed by Jagdish Rajpurohit. "I don't want to be categorised as a comedian," he says. Dave will be next seen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's production Shirin Farhad and Ekta Kapoor's Kya Super Kool Hain Hum.

ACTOR AS CHARACTER
Nawazuddin Siddiqui, 37, is the abusive Intelligence Bureau officer in Kahaani, the police informer Gopi in Paan Singh Tomar and the local journalist Rakesh in Peepli Live. Now the roles are getting bigger for the actor. In the role of a pimp, he is the second lead in Talaash, and plays a key role in Gangs Of Wasseypur, besides acting as the lead in four other films. He left his small town of Budhana near Muzaffarnagar to pursue theatre in Delhi.After six lean years, it's a different story now."I have struggled for a long time, so I feel good now," he says.

DR DO-IT-ALL
Americans know Dr Sanjay Gupta, 42, as CNN's award-winning chief medical correspondent. The neurosurgeon was also named among America's sexiest men alive by People magazine in 2003. But with his first novel Monday Mornings out on March 13, he becomes a novelist. Gupta describes the book as a peek behind the curtain at what really happens in a hospital. "The characters are from earlier stages of my life," Gupta told USA Today.

MEAN STREAK
As difficult as it is to imagine Imran Khan, 29, being anything but cute, he is ready to get his hands dirty playing an underworld don in Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai 2. Akshay Kumar takes over from Emraan Hashmi to play Shoaib Khan, modelled on Dawood Ibrahim, and Imran steps in as his rival Aslam in the sequel helmed by Milan Luthria. Things didn't go so well the last time he tried to look mean but then again, Kidnap was a long time ago.
