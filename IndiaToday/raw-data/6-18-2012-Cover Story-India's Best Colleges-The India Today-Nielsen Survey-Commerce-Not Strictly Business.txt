more than what is prescribed in the curriculum. "We have exchange programmes, special lectures and internships," says Jain, adding that students are sent on programmes to colleges in Malaysia, Japan and Switzerland to acquire a global perspective. "The exposure we get here is unparalleled," says Madhurima Jaiswal, 19, a first-year BCom student who will soon be leaving for Hong Kong to participate in the HSBC-McKinsey Business Case Competition representing India. "We are constantly inspired to raise the bar." Another unique feature of this college is its emphasis on teacher training. Faculty members are encouraged to engage in research projects and attend training workshops. This year, a few teachers were sent on a one-year course in finance to the London School of Economics to understand their methodology and style of teaching.
SRCC will soon establish a centre of excellence to groom teachers to international standards, which will require an investment of Rs 30 lakh. In March, the Government declared the college a National Centre for Corporate Governance, a first in Delhi. Jain now plans to seek DU ViceChancellor Dinesh Singh's permission to introduce a master's course in international business. Apart from its emphasis on academics, the college encourages its students to take part in a number of extracurricular activities. Its four-day festival, Crossroads, sees participants from all over India while student societies such as the dramatics society, debating society and English literary society constantly win accolades. Its list of alumni is impressive. Deutsche Bank Co-CEO Anshu Jain; Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley; Max Healthcare founder Analjit Singh; Atul Punj of

f there is one college that can get away with having a chip on its shoulder, it is Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC). Offering just two undergraduate courses, in BCom and economics, this institute has for years attracted the cream of the crop and maintained its premier position in the commerce stream. "Ours is a college that takes academics seriously and is committed to providing students with the right infrastructure to promote learning," says P.C. Jain, SRCC principal. He also prefers to let results do most of the

talking. In 2011, the top ranks in both BCom and economics in Delhi University (DU) went to SRCC students, as did the top 14 ranks in the results of BCom first year. No wonder the college has secured a perfect 100 score for quality of academic input, student care, infrastructure and placement opportunities in the INDIA TODAYNielsen best colleges survey 2012. At number two, St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, got an overall score of 70. Although SRCC falls under the purview of DU, its style of functioning is different from other colleges affiliated to the university. For one, it places great emphasis on helping students learn far

HISTORY
Established in 1920, it was first set up as Commercial School by seven leading businessmen in Delhi. After introducing a post-matriculation diploma programme in commerce, the institution graduated to college status in 1926 with affiliation to University of Delhi. The college finally renamed itself Shri Ram College of Commerce in its silver jubilee year in 1951. It shifted to its present campus in DU from Daryaganj in 1954 and finally opened its doors to girls in 1957.

BIG-TICKET OFFERS
 International mining firm Rio Tinto offered a Rs 30 lakh annual package to an SRCC graduate for a job in Australia.  Deutsche Bank offered Rs 15 lakh.  Citibank's best offer was Rs 12 lakh.

City-level ranking of a college is determined by its scores in the Top 50 national ranking. For those city colleges that do not figure in the toppers' list, only perceptual scores were considered for the above ranking.

Punj Lloyd and MD of Bharti Enterprises Akhil Gupta are just some of the many names on that list. "Cross the toll plaza from Gurgaon and look at the big companies that line the road. All of them have at least one SRCC alumnus," says a beaming Jain. Many of them have returned to their alma mater to deliver speeches and offer donations. Some of that largesse has enabled the college to build a state-of-the-art Resource Centre for Visually Impaired Students, install a lift to help handicapped students and

build new computer centres. "Best of all, we have ACs," exclaims a visibly proud Bhanu Pratap, 19, an economics student. Today, all 54 faculty rooms, 25 classrooms, offices, computer centres, libraries and the sports stadium are air-conditioned. Also excellent is SRCC's placement record. Year after year students have bagged impressive placements in reputed international firms such as Deutsche Bank, Google, Grant Thornton and American Express. This year, international mining firm Rio Tinto

surprised everyone by offering a salary package of Rs 30 lakh to an undergraduate student. In 2011, the college came under severe criticism for announcing a 100 per cent cut-off for admission to the BCom course. But Jain promises that the college will take a more lenient view this time around. "But it (cut-off) won't go too low because we want to continue to attract the best brains," he says.
