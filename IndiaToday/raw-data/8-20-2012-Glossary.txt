Preeti Desai got to relive
her days of being crowned Miss Great Britain in 2006, when she walked the ramp for designer Anita Dongre, resplendent in white. Yes, she looked great, but she will need something more to go on than just one film and being Abhay Deol's girlfriend.

BATHED IN GOLD
Enough has already been said about Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's weight, but after she appeared in a svelte form in an advertisement for a jewellery brand, it's back on the discussion board. She looks fantastic submerged in a sea of gold, but memories of her flaunting the post-baby weight at Cannes in May, have kicked off nagging doubts. Nine months after giving birth to daughter Aaradhya, we cannot help but ask, has she lost the weight or hasn't she?

DOUBLE TROUBLE
For those who cannot get enough of south Indian actor Suriya, 37, there is one more of him to love, in his latest film Maattrraan. He plays the role of conjoined twins in the film directed by K.V. Anand. But the double role also has its share of troubles. The actor had to take nearly 2,500 shots for the film, believed to be the most number for an actor in the Tamil film industry. There is also the question of how his co-star Kajal Agarwal will romance two of him. We'll just have to wait and watch.

BROTHERS IN ARMS
Randhir Kapoor, 67, and Vinod Khanna, 65, played long-lost brothers in Prakash Mehra's Haath Ki Safai in 1974, and again in Aakhri Daku in 1978. Three decades on, they will reunite in Prabhu Deva's Hindi remake of the Telugu film Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana. But here, they will be pitted against each other as conflicting fathers of the lead pair. Kapoor was last seen as Jacqueline Fernandez's father in Housefull 2 and Khanna is reprising the role of Prajapati Pandey in Dabangg 2. Can they revive the old charm?

SURIYA IN A DOUBLE ROLE

LIMELIGHT SHY
Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao's son Azad was 2011's best kept secret. Understandably, the eight-month boy's first outing turned into a big affair, when the family stepped out to catch a flight to Chicago. There were flashbulbs going off in the toddler's face as he snuggled wide-eyed against daddy dear. Better get used to it.

SNOOZE FEST
Monica Bedi, 37, has landed Harjit Ricky's Sirphire, her first Punjabi film. She is still making earnest efforts to clean up her image playing Simran, a "cultured, sober and religious"Punjabi girl. The film, about Punjabi culture being ruined by westernisation, releases on August 10. All the trappings of a delightful snooze fest.

These celebrities soaked up as much of the limelight as they could at the Lakme Fashion Week from August 3-7 in Mumbai before they got back to their bleak prospects

Few may have actually heard Shibani Dandekar sing, but the singer did make for a pretty sight when she took to the ramp with Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa choreographer Puneet Pathak. She was in a mirror work lehenga by fashion designer Payal Singhal. If only she did more than doll up and punctuate shows like Extraaa Innings and India's Sexiest Bachelor.

SHOW STOPPERS

Before her film Ekk Deewana Tha released this year, the most exciting things about Amy Jackson were her foreign nationality and speculation about her relationship with co-star Prateik. Now that has collapsed too.At least she looked good in a black Pernia Qureshi sari. When Sidhartha Mallya isn't shooting his mouth off in front of the camera, he is doing it on Twitter, in between becoming a certified ordained priest of the Universal Life Church. Thankfully, he walked quietly down the ramp in a black tuxedo as the showstopper for designer Komal Sood.

BROMANCE BREWS
Once rivals, Tamil actors Dhanush, 29, and Simbu, 29, are now friends. It started when Simbu tweeted a picture of them travelling together on a flight from Dubai in June. He followed it up with a lavish birthday bash for Dhanush, who now wants him to sing a song in Mariyaan. Will they move in together next? Hold that thought.
