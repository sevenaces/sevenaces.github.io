They are people with a criminal past. They are also very old now. Some of them are so weak that they can't walk without assistance. Yet the state regards these geriatrics in Rajasthan's jails as threats to society and insists on keeping them in. OMAR MOHAMMAD, 90

mar Mohammad, a farmer from Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, was convicted in 1985 for a robbery attempt a year earlier in a village in Tonk, Rajasthan. Released on bail after spending 20 months in jail, he absconded. In December 2010, he was jailed again. Now 90, Rajasthan's oldest prisoner, Mohammad is lodged in Tonk Jail. "Only once has my son come to see me," he says. He awaits release in May 2014. Badru Ram, 85, a farmer from Jhunjhunu district, has been lodged in Jaipur Central Jail since 1999 after he and his three sons were convicted for life for the death of two persons, including the local SHO, in a quarrel over water for cattle. One of the sons, Shiv Lal, died in jail. "What is the point in being here," he sighs, leaning on a younger convict as he walks. Also in Jaipur Central Jail is Jeevan Ram, 80, of Jaipur district, who killed his neighbour in 1991 over a land dispute. He remained on bail till 2001 when he was convicted for life along

with 13 relatives. "It is not an age to be in jail. It is time to be with grandchildren," he says. Fellow prisonmate Dana Ram, 70, is near-deaf, as is Asa Ram, 80. "I tie a cloth bandage around my legs to ease the pain so that I can sleep," says Asa Ram. Nathu Ram, 75, is confined to the bed and needs assistance to move around inside the prison. There are 141 convicts above 70 doing time in Rajasthan jails. Forty of them are too infirm to bear the rigours of prison life. There are 278 prisoners aged between 60 and 70, 34 of them are in bad shape. Mala Ram, 80, serving life imprisonment, died in Churu jail in October 2011 after spending 13 years and eight months behind bars. Braj Mohan, 68, a motor mechanic from Jhunjhunu district, is diabetic, can't see with one eye and fumbles when he speaks, narrating in laboured tones about how he hit a man with a stone after a minor scuffle in 2000, killing him. Mohan remained out on bail for 21 months before conviction in 2003. Ram Kumar Saini, 76, in Jaipur jail for 12 years, died of cancer in 2011 after the government did not respond to his mercy petition for six months. "Does it serve any purpose to keep geriatrics jailed?" says Rajasthan's Director General of Prisons (DGP) Omendra Bhardwaj as he looks at the list of old prisoners and settles in on the number two: Badlu Ram, 87, a life convict lodged in Alwar Jail since 2004 who needs assistance to walk and whose parole request has been rejected. Jail Superintendent Rakesh Mohan has recently ordered Badlu Ram's two sons, also convicted along with him for beating a man to death with sticks in Alwar district in 2003 over water for irrigation, to take care of him. "Old inmates queue up to entreat me for release on compassionate grounds whenever I visit any jail," the DGP says. The fate of old prisoners in jails across the country came into focus in June 2011 after Gorakhpur Jail authorities in Uttar Pradesh released India's oldest prisoner Brij Bihari Pandey, 108, convicted and jailed in 2009 for killing a rival chief priest in 1987, on bail. The same month, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok

Gehlot asked then governor Shivraj Patil to remit the sentence of Khalil Chisti, 79, a Pakistani professor currently lodged in Ajmer jail. Chisti was arrested for a murder in Ajmer in 1992 but released on bail soon after. In January 2011, he was convicted and imprisoned. Gehlot's recommendation hasn't been accepted yet. "If the Chief Minister can seek for an exception for Chisti, why not me?" asks Badlu Ram. Since 2006, the state government has stopped exercising discretion to grant general remission on account of national holidays to prisoners or permanent parole or early release in order to ensure a minimum 18 years for lifers. With no policy vis-à-vis old prisoners, jail officials struggle to find ways to take care of inmates who struggle to go to the toilet on their own, carry

water, wash clothes and eat chapatis. Many have seen their near and dear ones die of old age while they clock year after year in prison. Gopi Ram, 75, from Sikar district, was out on bail for 18 years and subsequently in Jaipur jail for 11 years for killing two over a land dispute in 1982. Three of his brothers, who were among the nine accused, have died in jail. His wife died at home in 2009. Anop Singh Rajput, 73, from Nagaur district, in the women's jail in Jaipur since 2001 for killing her daughter-inlaw, also lost her husband recently.

Her sentence runs till 2022. Bail often comes in handy. Harmind Ram, 76, a retired lance naik who fought three wars, was arrested for murdering his brother in 1995 but remained on bail from 2001 to 2008. He used that time to ensure marriages of his son and daughter before returning to Jaipur jail. Suren Singh, 81, now in Alwar jail, jumped bail in a 1973 case of killing three people and was rearrested in 2008 from Ferozepur in Punjab. "I got all my five children married, the last one just before my arrest," he says. Women prisoners are worse off.

"Women prisoners have lesser number of visitors than men, and fewer seek or get parole than their male counterparts," says Monika Agarwal, deputy superintendent of the women's prison in Jaipur. Women convicts who are eligible for parole often have no one to give surety. Ganga Bai, 77, from Gorwan in Chittorgarh, was arrested in 1999 for burning her daughter-in-law Naaru to death. In 12 years at the Jaipur women's jail, she has had a visitor only once. There's no one to stand surety for her to be let out on parole. Sharbati Meena, 75, of Alwar, who is in prison for burning her daughter-in-law to death, has not seen her son since she was brought to the Jaipur women's jail in 2004. Draupadi, 77, also in the same jail since 2004 for the murder of three persons at a wedding in Bhilwara in 2004, gets no visitors. Her sentence will run up to 2027. After Gehlot's request for Chisti's release created a furore, the Home Department has suggested examining each and every case of old prisoners for early release. DGP Bhardwaj is for an amendment in the prison manual to allow NGOs to take care of old inmates. The jail manual also prohibits their shifting to open jails. This year, Bhardwaj has got court approval to shift six old prisoners, including two women, to the open jail in Sanganer to be cared for by their younger convict relatives. If the provision becomes a part of the jail manual, authorities won't have to move court for individual cases. In the larger framework of working towards a more humane, compassionate society, this could be a small beginning. I
