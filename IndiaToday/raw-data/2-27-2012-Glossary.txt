WHOSE SONG IS IT?
The anthem Dhanush,28,composed for Sachin Tendulkar,which had nearly half-a-million hits within 24 hours,was suddenly removed from YouTube on February 12.Apparently JR Mediaworks had claimed a copyright infringement.All was well again when the Kolaveri team approached the company and the claim was withdrawn.But not before a Twitter war made things interesting.Dhanush's rival,actor Silambarasan (Simbu),28,tweeted,"Copy adikaradhula Chinaava vida bayangarama irrukangaley (Some persons behave very badly... their trend of copying might even put China to shame)." Dhanush tweeted back,"Some people smile at others'misery; I smile right back at them for not knowing the purpose of being a human being.It's called love",taking a dig at the `Love Anthem'Simbu's working on.Anthems are okay boys,but keep your Kolaveri private!

HOLLYWOOD BOUND
We know them for the edgy Splitsvilla and Roadies theme song. Now they're going global. Walt Disney has signed on rock band Agnee to compose the theme song for the dubbed version of the blockbuster-in-the-making, The Avengers. "It will be in Hindi. What's more challenging is that it is an inspirational song," says vocalist K. Mohan.

CRICKET SELLS
Actor Prakash Raj, 46, is over the moon, thanks to M.S. Dhoni. No, it's has nothing to do with Team India's marginally better performance of late. The actor, who usually plays the baddie in Kollywood films, has had a successful directorial venture with Dhoni, named after the Indian cricket captain. Based on the Marathi film Shikshanacha Aaicha Gho directed by Mahesh Manjrekar, Dhoni stars Mugdha Godse, Radhika Upte and Akash Puri. That's a win, all right.

WEDDING WITH ATIFF
After the Riteish-Genelia wedding, the industry headed to Goa for the next big-fat B-town wedding--David Dhawan's son Rohit got married on to girlfriend Jaanvi Desai. The Desi Boyz director decided to have a destination wedding with the who's who of Bollywood, including Ranbir Kapoor, Sonam Kapoor and Govinda, marking their presence. The wedding also got Ameesha Patel a lot of attention. She was reportedly wearing a chaniya choli which left little to the imagination and caused a tiff with Sanjay Dutt at the sangeet ceremony. Dutt got so bugged that he chose not to attend the wedding.

TRAILER OF THE WEEK
The trailer of Sajid Nadiadwala's Housefull 2: The Dirty Dozen promises Akshay Kumar, weddings, music, confusion and action. Sounds any different from the others we have seen so far? Not to us.You do have an ensemble cast of 12 actors to look out for, though.

Naeem Khan Mumbaiborn Khan, 53, boasts of a celebrity clientele, which includes Beyoncé, Eva Longoria and US First Lady Michelle Obama. Hollywood star Matt Damon was in attendance at the runway show. Khan's inspiration for the collection came from the bindi. Classic paisleys with threading, beading and applique ran the risk of making the outfits too busy, but the relaxed silhouettes in a predominantly black and white collection worked their magic. We are sure to see this collection on many red carpets in the near future.

WORD
OF THE

PERFECT MATCH
Everything about Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu should have reminded you of cookie-cutter romantic comedies. But writers Ayesha DeVitre and Shakun Batra turned routine into fresh romance."I met a lot of writers, but the problem with hiring them is that what comes out depends on the money we put in and I had none," says Batra, a first-time director. He found his "free-spirited storyteller"in Imran Khan's hair stylist, DeVitre, whom he knew from the sets of Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na. Unlike other writers, they worked on the characters before coming up with a concept. Perhaps that's where the film gets its zing from.

Controversial author Taslima Nasreen'S woes know no end. After continued bans on her books, now three films based on her works have been stalled for various reasons ranging from monetary issues to unviable locations. We're sure she's not buying that story.
