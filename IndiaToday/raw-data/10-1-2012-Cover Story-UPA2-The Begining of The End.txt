and Dhiraj Nayyar amata Banerjee waved her cellphone like a weapon in an epic battle. She told a packed press conference at Kolkata's Town Hall on September 18 that she had sent an SMS to Congress President Sonia Gandhi on September 14, soon after the Government announced it would liberalise FDI in four sectors--retail, aviation, non-news broadcasting and power exchanges. There was no answer. "I generally do not talk about personal communications, but I am today revealing that I sent a message to Soniaji four days ago saying I cannot agree with the decisions of the Central Government. I did not get a response. I had no other option. If somebody cuts my head off and then asks me to stay, that cannot work," said Banerjee in her trademark theatrical style. There was no confusion about her decisions. All her six Trinamool Congress (TMC) ministers would hand in their resignation to the Prime Minister at 3 p.m. on Friday, September 21, after "jumma namaaz (Muslim Friday prayers)". After all, her 19 MPs were critical to the survival of the Congress-led UPA Government reeling under Coalgate charges. Delhi, which was riding high on the wave of belated reforms it had unleashed after 18 months of policy paralysis to divert attention from corruption charges, was shocked. A sombre Congress General Secretary Janardan Dwivedi immediately briefed the media at the Congress headquarters and referred to Banerjee as a "valuable ally". At her 10 Janpath home next door to the party headquarters, Sonia went into a huddle with senior Congressmen including Ahmed Patel, A.K. Antony and P. Chidambaram. The mood there was much more realistic. One of them SMSed a Cabinet colleague saying, "This is

among the ministers on September 13. The Prime Minister did, however, inform another ally of his plans. On September 12, he asked Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar to be present in Delhi for the September 14 Cabinet meeting as "some important decisions had to be taken", including the proposed FDI in retail. Manmohan knew that pro-reformist Pawar would back him. Pawar cancelled his party's September 14-16 national convention in Vadodara and stayed back in Delhi. Banerjee was present at the August 22 UPA coordination committee meeting when the Prime Minister had brought up FDI in retail. But she fobbed him off saying that she would discuss this with him later in private. After that, it was only on the afternoon of September 14 that PMO officials tried to contact Banerjee both on her mobile and landline. She did not take the calls. Then the Prime Minister called Union Railway Minister Mukul Roy, who was in Delhi at the time. Roy told the Prime Minister that he would not be able to attend the meeting as he had to go for the President's civic reception in Kolkata that evening. This did not stop Manmohan from going ahead with his series of aggressive reforms. This was a Manmohan in search of his nuclear moment. And once again, to save his image, he had put the Government at stake. As a TMC MP commented wryly, "This is the reaction of the American media attacking the Prime Minister." After the Planning Commission meeting, Manmohan met Cabinet colleagues Chidambaram, Pawar, Kamal Nath and Sushilkumar Shinde. He briefed them about his attempts to reach Banerjee. He also said that he was aware that Roy was in Delhi till well after the Cabinet meeting ended on Friday evening, even though he had said he would be in Kolkata. Chidambaram added that he had also tried calling West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra who did not respond either. Nath pointed out that Banerjee's decision was a political one: "Mamata's agenda is elections. She is not going to change her mind." The Prime Minister once again

the beginning of the end." The Congress had totally misread the mood at Writers' Buildings in Kolkata. It did not pay much attention to Banerjee's ultimatum, delivered on September 14, demanding that the Government change its mind on FDI in retail, the cap on LPG subsidy and the Rs 5 diesel price hike, within 72 hours. Congress managers had blithely assumed that she would bluster just as she had done during the presidential polls in July, and then purr back into line. Finance Minister Chidambaram implicitly shrugged away her statement as a tantrum at a press conference on September 17 when he ruled out rollback on FDI. The worst-case scenario envisaged by the Congress was that Banerjee would pull out her ministers and give outside support. A Congress general secretary even joked that this was one way of wresting the railway ministry from her catastrophic control. As things turned out, the Congress learnt of Banerjee's decision on national television, along with the rest of the country. The TMC chief and Bengal Chief Minister had done her best to convey the seriousness of her intentions. She met President Pranab Mukherjee, on a four-day visit to Kolkata between

September 14 and 17, thrice. She requested a one-on-one meeting with him during the dinner hosted by Governor M.K. Narayanan on September 15. According to a well-placed source, she told Mukherjee that she was "extremely hurt" by the developments and asked him to convey her sentiment to the Government.

DAMAGE CONTROL
Congress speed-dials Banerjee in vain
Congress began some damage control only on September 19, when Chidambaram told reporters in Delhi: "We tried to speak to her four days ago." Congress sources started releasing details of the many phone calls that Chidambaram, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Sonia and even her political secretary Ahmed Patel made to Banerjee. But the TMC chief claims that the only time the Government tried to consult her on FDI in retail was a few hours before the Cabinet meeting on September 14--when she was busy planning a rally against the diesel price hike--and not after her pullout. FDI in multi-brand retail was not listed on the agenda, though a Cabinet note on allowing foreign airlines to invest in aviation was circulated

tried to call Banerjee on September 16, at 7 p.m. and 8.30 p.m in vain. On September 17, Sonia tried to contact her but it was too late.

CALLING NEWALLIES
Mulayam,Mayawati to the rescue?
The consensus within the Congress now is that the party should play Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Mulayam Singh Yadav against Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati. It is banking on the fact that neither wants elections right now. "Mayawati may even agree to join the Government. She is not in power both at the Centre and the state," says a Congress general secretary. Sonia has asked all Congressruled states to roll back the LPG cap from six to nine cylinders a year. "We can also roll back the diesel price hike from Rs 5 to Rs 3," confided a Union minister of state. For the moment, however, both Mayawati and Mulayam are making the Congress sweat it out. Mayawati has announced that her party will take a final decision on UPA's "anti-people" policies on October 9. "Let this be a wake-up call for the Congress. What has it given to the people, other than price rise and corruption?" Mulayam said on September 19. This was not quite the language of a potential partner in government, but Congress hopes remain alive despite his relationship with Banerjee. On September 12, the West Bengal Chief Minister met

her Uttar Pradesh counterpart Akhilesh Yadav in Kolkata. Banerjee, say sources, sought his cooperation in fighting the "anti-people" policies pursued by the Centre and growing corruption. The Congress may want to play some cynical politics to retain both parties in order to survive in power. Both Mulayam and Mayawati have a simple lever in the leverage game: To see who Congress will support in the future confrontation. Congress wants to get both onside, which they understand but will not accept. The problem is that the loss of either will put the UPA on the wrong side of the seesaw. Even constant allies such as DMK are unhappy that they were not consulted over the diesel price hike. SP's Ram Gopal Yadav pointed out that "the Congress is behaving as if it commands a majority on its own". This is a view echoed by most allies. As Banerjee said, "I was called for a coordination meeting but it became an `ordination' meeting." But when DMK announced that it would join the `Bharat bandh' along with SP, BJP and the Left against the price hike on September 20, in one stroke, Manmohan managed to unite the most unlikely of enemies-- DMK and AIADMK; TMC and the Left; the Left and BJP; and SP and BJP. BJP has, for the moment, decided to sit back and watch UPA flounder under the weight of its contradictions. "After the withdrawal of support by TMC, it is only a matter of time

before the Government collapses," said BJP leader L.K. Advani on September 19. After the `Bharat bandh', BJP will seek a meeting with President Mukherjee to request a special session of Parliament to discuss the Government's `FDI in multi-brand retail' announcement. After all, as leader of the House, noted Advani, Mukherjee had said on the floor of the Lok Sabha on December 7, 2011, that the Government would not push FDI until there was consensus.

R.I.P. ANIMALSPIRITS
Full-scale reforms will elude UPA
But what of the Prime Minister's desperate attempt to revive his animal spirits? Will his decisions survive the gathering uncertainty? On September 15, speaking at a meeting of the full Planning Commission, which adopted a target growth rate of 8.2 per cent between 2012 and 2017, the Prime Minister had unleashed his inner lion king, laying out three scenarios for growth. He called the first scenario "strong inclusive growth" (8.2 per cent), the second "insufficient action" (6-6.5 per cent) and the third "policy logjam" (the current 5 per cent). Said the Prime Minister, "I believe we can make Scenario I possible. It will take courage and some risks." The Sensex was euphoric, rising by more than 400 points in a single day. India Inc, which had long complained about a governance deficit, reacted positively. But in the process, the Prime Minister may have lost not just an im-

portant ally but also the aam aadmi who gave him his job. The diesel hike and the cap on subsidised LPG cylinders are important signals of fiscal correction but they do not provide a happy narrative to sell to the people in the run-up to an electorate which has been battling inflation at near-double digits for three years now. In the short run, both measures will fuel inflation and overburden an aam aadmi. The diesel price hike is expected to increase the rate of inflation by almost 1 percentage point. In its defence, the Government claims that the usage of diesel in rural areas is just 15 per cent, so it will not affect its core constituency of farmers. But then, diesel is used to fuel trucks that carry agricultural goods across the country. There will thus be an impact on food inflation, which hurts the aam aadmi the most. Data shows a doubling in prices of some fruits and vegetables within three days of the diesel price hike as traders adjust their price expectations. In the longer run of two-three years, a significant fiscal correction will reduce inflationary pressures. But to do that, the Government needs to completely decontrol the price of diesel, which means allowing the price to rise by a further Rs 10-15 per litre, and rationalise other subsidies on food and fertiliser. On September 17, Chidambaram told the media that even after these hikes, the Government will be "lucky" to meet its fiscal deficit target of 5.1 per cent for 2012-13. Politically, for a Government reduced to a minority, raising the prices of diesel further and rationalising other subsidies is almost impossible for the rest of its term in office. SP and BSP are unlikely to support a complete decontrol. Worryingly for the Government, any rollback on these measures will not just dent fiscal targets but also its credibility. Though Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia has ruled out any rollback, UPA Chairperson Sonia is working behind the scenes on a compromise. The reality of what the FDI reform announcements will deliver on the ground is also sobering. The big-ticket announcement, on permitting 51 per cent FDI in multi-brand retail, may turn

Do you think the measures announced are sufficient to give a significant push to growth? Will the measures increase inflation over the next 12 months? Do you think RBI should have cut interest rates to boost the Government announcements?

 The measures announced by the Government are not yet sufficient to boost growth. Much more remains to be done.

 Not immediately, but Government should get foreign capital flowing, give more headroom to RBI for monetary easing and start process of improving farm logistics.

 They are a good start and have changed the investment mood. Reforms have to be sustained, however, for growth to revert to 8-9 per cent trajectory.

 Not sufficient for a significant push. A series of measures is needed to unblock supply side constraints that will have impact on inflation and growth.

out to be a damp squib if the biggest states choose to use the opt-out clause. So far, 16 states have declared opposition to retail FDI and only 12 have spoken out in favour. The chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal and chief ministers of all BJP-ruled states have made their opposition explicit. The incentive for Walmart or Tesco to invest large sums of money when the largest chunks of the Indian market are shut out will be limited.

he prospects of big-ticket investments in aviation are slightly better. There are already reports of Etihad Airlines of Abu Dhabi expressing interest in acquiring a share in Jet Airways. However, the protracted problems of the aviation sector--most prominently huge debt, but also policy issues like the high price of aviation fuel--which will take much longer to solve means that any turnaround will take time, longer than the one-and-a-half years UPA 2 has left. By themselves, as the consensus of INDIA TODAY's Board of Economists reveals (see box), the FDI measures are insufficient to raise growth to even the 8.4 per cent level of 2010-11. The most serious constraint to

growth is infrastructure, where the bottlenecks of multiple clearances have brought the sector to a halt. According to one official, at least 37 projects in the roads sector have failed to achieve financial closure in over a year because of problems in environmental and forest clearances. Private investment in roads has fallen dramatically. "You get one clearance for forest, but then you don't get another clearance for environment," says an official. Chidambaram believes he has a solution for such bottlenecks: The proposed constitution of a National Investment Board (NIB), chaired by the Prime Minister, which will be a single window for clearance of all projects above a certain size. According to senior officials, the Government has realised that GoMs have proved ineffective in sorting out inter-ministerial differences. The real problem ministries are the ministries of environment and forests, coal, mines and power. Empowering NIB will require a reallocation of business rules, which will mean taking away the power of granting permissions from these ministries. "That will be controversial," says an official. It will also end up placing accountability for all major projects on PMO. Burnt by Coalgate, the Prime Minister may not accept the NIB idea.

Q Q Q

 The measures won't increase inflation because the fiscal deficit may decline. That's why Government has cut subsidies.

 Inflation won't increase significantly. It may be affected in the short term, but fuel price hike alone won't have any effect in the long run.

 Fuel price hike will increase wholesale price index by 75-80 basis points over the next four months. But over 12 months impact will be zero.  A gradual reduction in cost of funds for banks will enhance the commercial viability of projects, create capacities and ease supply bottlenecks.

 The measures will not increase inflation. But inflation might perk up in the next quarter due to the diesel price hike.

 The increase in diesel prices will have a short-term impact. Medium-term inflationary conditions, however, remain unaffected.

 Inflation and fiscal deficit are high. The Reserve Bank of India should cut interest rate in October.

 Yes, a marginal cut is possible, since we can expect some rupee strengthening, which would help anchor inflation expectations.

 The Reserve Bank of India's decision to cut interest rates will give a boost to the Government's reforms announcements.

 There will be a positive though marginal impact. At the same time, heavy Government borrowing will negate the impact.

What other measures does the Government need to take to revive the economy?

 The Government needs to take administrative measures. It has to address lack of decision-making, land acquisition, forest clearances and coal shortages.

 The Government has to promote a rise in investment, focus on addressing domestic bottlenecks, improve the composition and quality of its expenditure.

 The most immediate steps are to ensure coal supplies to power projects and expedite clearances for projects that are stalled.

 The Government should pass GST, increase FDI cap in insurance to 49 per cent, privatise Coal India Limited and Air India.

 The Government has to get moving on goods and services tax and address power shortages. Public sector disinvestment can have an immediate impact.

Some bureaucrats argue that the Board would be overkill. "You are moving from a system where clearances had to be taken at a very low level, say a zonal forest officer, to a system in which clearance will be decided at the highest level, the Prime Minister," says the official. "They are setting the Prime Minister up for failure," the official concludes.

RED TAPE ON REFORM
Bureaucrats launch civil disobedience
The bureaucracy isn't too keen to help Manmohan avoid failure. Bureaucrats are still smarting over the treatment handed out to their colleague, former telecom secretary Siddharth Behura, in the 2G case. "We are determined to take our revenge," said one senior official. Circumstances make it easier for bureaucrats to take a tough `do-nothing' stand. Many bureaucrats don't believe the Government will last its full term, which means that their hold-out period will be short. For others, even if the Government lasts its full term, it is not worth being closely identified with it, since they believe UPA is unlikely to return to power. Those on the lookout for plum jobs, whether in service or post-retirement circa 2014, are doing their best to distance themselves from UPA. Says one bureaucrat, "The days when we were dependent on the Government for a post-retirement job are over. Many exbureaucrats are now employed in the private sector." The fact that the bureaucracy sees little to gain from supporting UPA is bad news for a Government looking for officials to implement reforms. Manmohan's reformist announcements may have steered public attention away from Coalgate, but the spectre of corruption will continue to haunt him. While the uproar was peaking, 2G slipped back into the news. On September 18, deposing before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on 2G, RBI Governor D. Subbarao, who was finance secretary when the scam took place, said that both the Prime Minister and then finance minister Chidambaram were party to the decisions made. Just when Manmohan thought 2G was behind him, it has come up again. That is a sign of great trouble ahead. with Devesh Kumar

THE LAST HOPE
NEW

By Priya Sahgal

Rahul is the designated face of the Congress in the next General Elections. But will he take over in the party's most crucial hour?

he camera was about to click when Sonia Gandhi looked away from the lens. The Congress president was surrounded by the NSUI team that won the Delhi University elections on September 15. Right in the middle of the photo-op, she turned around to look for Rahul Gandhi, lingering in the background. Only when Rahul was part of the frame did Sonia smile. It's not just Sonia who is looking for Rahul. The last week has been one of

the toughest for the party. Its government at the Centre is tottering. But Rahul is missing in action. And this is a man who is tipped to lead the party in the near future. He is not out there talking to allies and troubleshooting. One reason for this is that barring Omar Abdullah, he does not have an equation with any ally. This is in sharp contrast to Sonia's easy rapport with coalition leaders--even when Mamata Banerjee withdrew support from UPA 2, the West Bengal Chief Minister hastened to add that her "personal equation" with the Congress president remained

"unchanged". Rahul, however, did hold his weekly janta durbar in Delhi on September 20, the day of the `Bharat bandh', to show his indifference. On September 13, Rahul told reporters in Amethi that he will be taking on a larger role soon. But the current crisis may delay his elevation. According to a senior party general secretary, "The timing will be decided by the mother and son We still don't know what his designation will be but all the general secretaries will report to him." In the meantime, Rahul remains as enigmatic. Congressmen are also confused

whether Rahul supports FDI in retail. Most have forgotten that he had endorsed FDI in December 2011 at a rally in Farrukhabad when he called it a pro-farmers measure that would help them get better prices. "While potato chips sell for Rs 10 a packet, farmers don't even get Re 1 for the potatoes," he had said. But ever since his Uttar Pradesh election defeat, Rahul has retreated into a shell of silence. He was touring Amethi when the Government announced the diesel price hike on September 13. His constituents surrounded his guest house in Munshiganj protesting against the hike. On television, UPA allies criticised the Government. Yet Rahul did not come out in UPA's defence. If there is one lesson Rahul should have learnt from his recent Amethi trip, it is that his silence is no longer enigmatic. Instead, it only adds to the anger and frustration that is slowly building against him. On September 13, while inaugurating a branch of the UCO bank in Bhadar, Uttar Pradesh, he was accosted by the crowd. "Forget ATM machines. Give us roads and jobs," said one. Rahul heard the protests but did not react. "Ours is a VIP constituency,

(FROM LEFT) PRIYANKA GANDHI, ROBERT VADRA AND SONIA GANDHI IN DELHI

but still we don't get good roads," complains Bhadar native Gayatri Prasad Prajapati. The 60-year-old farmer points to the fact that roads in neighbouring Rampur Khas are much better. Whenever Rahul is in Amethi, he holds a janta durbar at the Munshiganj Guest House. But slowly, this is losing its appeal as there is little follow-up. After the UP Assembly elections in February-March, this is only Rahul's second visit to Amethi, the first being in May. "Rahul Gandhi does not believe in making empty promises. He'd rather deliver than promise," defends Akhilesh Pratap Singh, Congress MLA. Rahul is wary of playing the traditional politics of patronage. While campaigning for the Assam polls in April 2011, he met a group of youngsters who complained that the Northeast was being discriminated against when it came to getting jobs in Delhi. "I don't think so," replied Rahul. "I see a lot of people from the North-east in the hospitality business." Blunt, and not quite what the youngsters wanted to hear. Similarly in Chhattisgarh while campaigning for the 2007 state polls,

he was asked by a villager in Bastar for more handpumps in the area. Instead of glibly promising one, he said: "Let me check and see if the water table in your village allows it." The people in Amethi claim that his constituency office in Delhi has a sign that says `No Naukri No Transfers'. This is only apocryphal but it has become part of the Rahul legend. Outside Amethi, Rahul's work style remains a mystery. He prefers to work with his own team from his home at 12 Tughlaq Lane instead of the Congress headquarters. During the Uttar Pradesh campaign, he brought in a team of Youth Congress workers to assist him instead of involving the local leadership. If he is serious about playing a larger role, then he needs to shed his mistrust of the Congress worker. "Yeh toh bina bane, bane-banaye hain (Without being made, he is readymade)," scoffs Raveen Pratap Singh, 50, a Congress worker from Tikarmafi village in Amethi. "Why does he need a designation to play a more active role?" he adds. It sums up the mood in the rest of the party.
