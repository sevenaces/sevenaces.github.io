Rave Review
Siddhant Kapoor, 29, isn't starting out with dad Shakti Kapoor's role in the Satte Pe Satta remake. Instead, he plays a sharp shooter Gyanchod in Sanjay Gupta's Shootout At Wadala. He gets his hands dirtier in Anurag Kashyap's Ugly as a dark character embroiled in drugs, with aunt Tejaswini Kolhapure for company. Being detained at a suspected rave party should come in handy.

DANCING QUEEN
Born in Iran and raised in Sweden, Maryam Zakaria is the new sultry siren on the block. Seen sharing screen space with Kareena Kapoor in the mujra number in the forthcoming Agent Vinod, Zakaria was the first to open a Bollywood dance school, Indisk Dans School, in Sweden. "Iranians love Bollywood films," she says. She has a few special appearances in southern movies to her credit, but Agent Vinod will be her first acting role in Bollywood. "I have done some action scenes with Saif Ali Khan. It's great to work with two of the finest actors in Bollywood," she says. Let's hope her kicks are as strong as her latka-jhatkas.
