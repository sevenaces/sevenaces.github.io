oon after Aung San Suu Kyi won the 2012 by-elections in Myanmar, she said that she wished to visit her alma mater Lady Shri Ram College (LSR) for Women in Delhi. Even as she spoke, her college, where she completed her BA in political science in 1964, was in a tizzy of activity. Festooned with banners celebrating her win, the college had organised a series of lectures and special movie screenings in her honour. "We at LSR are proud of every feat, no matter how large or small, that our alumni accomplish. We have a long-standing history of mentoring some of the world's most eminent leaders," says Meenakshi Gopinath, LSR principal. Given the list of academics, politicians, socialists, corporate leaders, journalists and economists that have emerged from within the red brick walls and lush gardens of the LSR campus, it is little surprise that the college still retains its position in the INDIA TODAY-Nielsen survey as the best arts college in India for the third year in a row. "Over the past year, one of our primary focuses has been on attempting to break out of the tyranny of the received syllabus. We have spent considerable time in ensuring our students gain international exposure and study experience," says Gopinath. To this effect, the college held an Autumn School in 2011 in partnership with the Heinrich Böll Foundation. The interactive sessions on global finance and human security had a number of guest students from Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Pakistan and China. Another highlight of the previous academic year was an international con-

LSR has a long tradition of building community and social spirit among students. It has an active Women Development Cell, Differently-abled Development Cell and NHS Cell.

At number two, St. Stephen's College has also worked hard to supplement the generic university syllabus. Many international scholars have been invited to lecture at the college. "From Fulbright scholars in economics to English professors from the University of Boston, we've tried our best to give students a wholesome view of the field they are studying in.

holds optional courses in the arts and cultures of the Indian subcontinent," says Valson Thampu, principal, St. Stephen's. St. Xavier's College, Mumbai, also has a lot to offer students wishing to undertake a course in arts. Ranked third in the country, the college seeks to strike a balance between academic and cultural exposure with special emphasis placed on activities that stimulate value formation. "Our college excels in the teaching of the social sciences and humanities. We have pioneered the teaching of Indian history and culture and languages like Pali and Arabic through the world renowned Heras Institute. St. Xavier's is also the first and only autonomous college under the University of Mumbai. The freedom to develop our own curriculum and teaching-evaluation pedagogy applying the Blooms taxonomy, with projects to facilitate enquiry-based learning, has meant an exciting rise in the quality of education," says Frazer Mascarenhas SJ, principal, St. Xavier's, Mumbai. So what distinguishes LSR from every other art college in India? "Leadership with Social Responsibility is what LSR really stands for. Our strength comes from the sense of ownership that the faculty brings to every course," says Gopinath.
