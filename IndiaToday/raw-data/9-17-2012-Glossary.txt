STARTING BIG
Anand Gandhi, 31, flags off the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6 with Ship Of Theseus, a film that traces the lives of four people across three continents. He has made the award-winning play Sugandhi and short film Right Here Right Now besides writing screenplays for TV shows like Kahani Ghar Ki.

Shabana Azmi's charity fashion show with Manish Malhotra had several hits but almost as many misses

It's remarkable how

MALAIKA ARORA KHAN is still a top
item girl despite her years. She never lets us forget how hard she works on staying in shape by sticking to the tiniest of clothes. But hey, she looks pretty good covered up too.

BOOKED AND BOUND
With so many hankering to know the details of her life, Kareena Kapoor is volunteering information on her own. It's her style secrets no less. In a book titled Style Diary of a Bollywood Diva that releases this December, she will apparently reveal the details of her fitness regime, beauty secrets and how she came to look the way she does now. We'll curb the excitement till she delivers the goods.

IMRAN KHAN in a black
sherwani on the ramp was clean shaven after a long time. The unkempt beard that he had grown for Vishal Bhardwaj's Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola gave him a certain ruggedness but isn't he prettier without it?

RIYA SEN seemed intent on >> hiding behind her hair. She
must have been worried someone would recognise her and quiz her on what she does in between her attendance at fashion events. If she was so keen on not being seen, she could have simply stayed away.

Malhotra clearly doesn't like SONAKSHI SINHA. The designer put her in a flared outfit that added volume she could do without, and then sent her down the ramp hand in hand with Priyanka Chopra who was baring her toned midriff under a tiny choli. That's just mean.

WEEK

MAKING MUSIC
Tannishtha Chatterjee, 33, has a small role in Joe Wright's big film. But as Romanian gypsy Masha in Anna Karenina, she is the only one who gets to sing in the film adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's classic. She matched her vocal skills to a `sweet lullaby' composed by Wright's wife Anoushka Shankar. The film stars Keira Knightley and Jude Law. Brick Lane and Road, Movie showed us she can act, and now we can get to hear her sing.

HOME CALL
Ashton Kutcher's trip to India doubled up as a goodwill mission. He paid a visit to Apne Aap, a grassroots movement to end sex trafficking in Delhi. He went with father Larry and is believed to have done a little bhangra with the girls as well.

Ranjit Ricky Gill, a
25-year-old Republican Party leader, was the third AmericanIndian invited to address the convention after Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley, and the only one contesting for a seat in the House of Representatives.

Nikki Haley, South
Carolina governor and a key speaker at the convention, began with how her parents moved to the US from India. Then true to Republican form, she went straight for the jugular: Obama's tax policies on business owners.

Ishwar Singh, the first Sikh to speak at a national convention and member of Sikh Society of Central Florida, led the invocation. Many had faulted the Republicans for opposing gun control, after the horrific shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in August.
