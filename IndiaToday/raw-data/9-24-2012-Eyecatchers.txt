RAUT

CHOUDHURY

THE BOSS LADY
Move over boys, Richa Chadda has had enough of playing wife and mother to the mafia. She is taking over the reins of her own fiefdom as mafia don Boli Punjaban in the comedy Fukrey, produced by Ritesh Sidhwani. TV actor Pulkit Samrat is in the lead, with firsttime director Mrigdeep Singh Lamba at the helm. After mothering two generations of the mafia in Gangs Of Wasseypur, she can teach them a thing or two.
CHADDA
YOGEN SHAH

Shock and Awe
She was the wild child in Mira Nair's Mississippi Masala,and a sex siren in Kama Sutra.So Sarita Choudhury's sari-clad,stern,almost menacing portrayal of the `Prime Minister'in Deepa Mehta's Midnight's Children may come as a bit of a shock.The 46year-old New York-based BengaliEnglish actor was last seen as a troubled homemaker in Sona Jain's For Real in 2010,but as Indira Gandhi, she will not be forgotten in a hurry.
MASKARA AND DAS

RAMP ROUT
Model Alesia Raut, 30,has strayed off the ramp before,to shake a leg in music videos Meri beri ke ber and Ek aankh maro.She brings out her dancing shoes again after a gap of over eight years for an item number, Tu kar bhala toh ho bhala, in Chetan Singh's Karu Toh Karu Kya."The song needed lots of attitude,but sexiness is an attitude which I wear quite often on the ramp," she says.How modest.
YOGEN SHAH

Couple's Retreat
Nandita Das, 42,takes to the stage after eight years in a play she is acting in and producing with husband Subodh Maskara. The two-person play, Between The Lines,is a first for Maskara,otherwise an environmental entrepreneur, and a first time as director for Das.They play a lawyer couple on opposing sides in an attempted murder case.The play's six city tour kicks off in Ahmedabad on September 30.Says Das,"We both believe in the adage that `Couples who do things together,stay together.'"
