SHINE ON STARLET
After actor Shilpa Shetty's tumultuous stint on the British reality show Celebrity Big Brother, another desi girl has entered the Big Brother house. Meet Deana Uppal, 23, Miss India UK 2012, who is having petty outbursts inside the house on Season 13 of the show, while dancing to Bollywood tunes. A resident of Birmingham, Uppal has tried her luck in Bollywood as well. She danced to the forgettable item song Naino Wali Whisky in Praveen Dabbas's directorial debut Sahi Dhandhe Galat Bande. "I'm eager to make it big in Bollywood," she says. How about trying something new?
