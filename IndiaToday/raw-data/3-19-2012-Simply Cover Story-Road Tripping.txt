Neemrana Fort Palace One of India's oldest heritage hotels and also one of its most beautiful, formerly owned by descendants of Prithviraj Chauhan III, this palace offers a magnificent view from its hilltop vantage--and a superb experience. Neemrana Fort Palace taught India that a hotel need not be in a destination, it can be the destination. A hotel only in the very broad sense of the word, Neemrana is part heritage monument and part exclusive getaway; a modern marvel with history. On the

National Highway between Delhi and Jaipur, the 500 year old palace is built into the mountainside in a stepped layout, and extravagant lawns dress the exteriors. The stunning fort cuts right into the edge of the mountain. Décor is simple and low-key, not the plush fivestar variety. Yet Neemrana is extremely stylish, with a heady mix of colonial and Indian antiques and object d'art. But the real romance of Neemrana is simply in leaving your ordinary world as you make your way up its curved driveway to the majestic, ancient spiked wooden doors.

various forested areas of Cheena Peak, Snow View Point and Kilbury. The quaint little town of Pangot with a population of only about 100-150 people seldom sees too many people who stay here for too long, as visitors mostly spend their time observing migratory birds or wandering about the lush green slopes. At least 300 species of birds have been recorded here. Start your day with an early morning (the birds are only visible till 7:30 pm) and make a short trek if you are really keen to get a glimpse of the birds. The trek which is a 10 km long trail takes you to Naina Peak via Kilbury. Walk through the grassland and look out for bird species such as the Lammergeier, Himalayan griffon, Mountain-hawk eagle, Blue-winged minla, Forktail, a large variety of woodpeckers including the beautiful Rufousbellied woodpecker, and pheasants such as Khalij, Cheer and Koklas that fly down to Pangot from upper Himalayan region to escape  by Ekta Alreja the harsh winters.

Qila Ladhran If you're looking for a weekend getaway option that includes sumptuous Punjabi cuisine, and lots of shopping, then look no further. Located on the ChandigarhLudhiana highway is Qila Ladhran, a 300 year old haveli that has now been converted into a boutique hotel. About six hours drive from Delhi, The Ladhran Fort, which belonged to Soumindra Guron's late husband, Captain Amarjit Singh, is a quaint boutique hotel located a little away from the city. With lush greenery all around, this haveli recreates an old world charm with its brick floors,

high ceilings and traditional Punjabi handicrafts on display. On entering the huge Iron Gate, you'll find yourself in the courtyard-- stretch out on the manji and quench your thirst with a kulhad of lassi. The rooms lined along the courtyard house the items on sale, shop for exclusive designer wear, hand-painted fabrics, traditional phulkari dupattas, antiques replicas, home décor items and teakwood furniture. Inform them about your visit in advance, and they'll prepare a finger licking meal (with oodles of ghee) that includes sarson ka saag, maki di roti, butter chicken, gajar ka halwa, kheer and much more. The haveli does not

have accommodation facilities yet and you will have to head back to the nearby Chandigarh or Ludhiana for the night, after you're done with the day's activities.

The holy shrine
Thousands visit Amritsar every day to seek blessings from the almighty at the Golden Temple. Apart from the holiest of all Gurudwaras, Amritsar is also home to many other monuments of historical relevance including the summer palace of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Ram Tirath which is believed to be Maharishi Valmiki's ashram, amongst others. Often referred to as the Berlin Wall of Asia, the Wagah Border near Amritsar sees great crowds on either side every evening, who come down to witness the `Beating the Retreat' ceremony at the border. While here, visit the many bazaars around the Golden Temple. Each lane has its own retail speciality--from bridal trousseau and vibrant Punjabi juttis to a variety of dry fruits and Amritsari specialities of vadiyan and papad.

Jim Corbett "My photographs and movies are better trophies than a stuffed corpse or a furry rug," Jim Corbett, the legendary hunter turned conservationist had once proclaimed. Having led a war against poachers and helped in setting up the magnificent reserve, it was aptly named after him in 1957. Apart from tigers at Corbett, you can also spot the Himalyan black bears, wild boars, a variety of birds and gharials (fish-eating crocodiles) along the banks of the Ramganga. Visitors can opt for different safari routes--Bijrani, Dhikala, Jhirna and Lohachaur--and travel in open jeeps. About nine kilometres from Ramnagar, Bijrani offers the quickest safari inside the Naitional Park, while Lohachaur is preferred mostly by bird watchers. The elephant safari at Dhikala is ideal for those wanting to observe wildlife at close quarters. Make sure that you plan your safari in advance since only a limited number of jeeps can enter the Corbett National Park on any given day. A government guide is mandatory here  by Shilpa Mehta as well.

Fort town
Kumbhalgarh This town with numerous forts is fast becoming one of the more popular tourist destinations in Rajasthan. The fort wall here is an astounding 36 km long and the fort itself is surrounded by 13 mountain peaks, guarded by seven great gates and seven walls, strengthened by rounded bastions and mammoth watchtowers. The meandering roads here lead through deep ravines and thick forests. It has many sites for the tourist who's willing to explore. On top of the fort is the Badal Mahal Palace which has beautiful sections painted with delicate pastel colou-

red murals. The palace was rebuilt by Rana Fateh Singh in the late 19th century. Haldighati, where the famous battle between Rana Pratap and the forces of the Mughal Emperor Akbar was fought lies here as well. The Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary is also worth a visit. This is one of the few wildlife parks in the country that allows horse safaris. If you want to further explore this region, then the Ranakpur Temples, situated around 50 Km from Kumbhalgarh are a good choice. The town of Kankroli nearby with a pretty palace on the hilltop also offers a beautiful hideout.

Thousands congregate at either side of the river banks and the Ganga, aglow with the phosphorescence of a million diyas and marigold petals, is an ethereal sight. Apart from the bazaars and temples, there's precious little to do in Haridwar. However, you can get your adrenaline flowing at nearby Rishikesh, which has almost everything Haridwar does, except on a smaller scale, and in addition, offers excellent opportunities for white water rafting.
