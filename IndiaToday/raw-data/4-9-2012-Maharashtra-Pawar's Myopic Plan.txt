PAWAR'S MYOPIC PLAN
Maharashtra is the only state without a draft for the 11th Five-Year Plan

aharashtra is the only state which has still not drafted its 11th Five-Year Plan which ended on March 31 this year. Finance Minister Ajit Pawar announced on March 26 that the 12th Five-Year Plan , which is supposed to be in place from April 1, would be of Rs 2,75,000 crore but his department has not yet drafted its outlay. Instead, the state has adopted yearly planning. Policy experts as well as Pawar's opponents allege that the annual plan is ineffective and leads to rampant corruption. Pawar's ineffective planning of state revenues is destroying the industrially developed state's fortunes. Maharashtra is lagging behind in various key sectors, including irrigation and health. The Planning Commission had set an infant mortality rate upper limit of 15 per thousand people by 2012 for the state. But Maharashtra could do no better than 28. Almost 58 per cent of the paediatricians' posts are lying vacant. The Centre had allotted the state Rs 1,60,660 crore for the 11th FiveYear Plan but it could spend only 84 per cent of the amount. Other industrially developed states such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat have spent almost 90 per cent of the funds. On March 26, Governor

K. Sankaranarayanan expressed concern at the slow pace of irrigation projects in Vidarbha. He has asked the state government to follow guidelines set by the Planning Commission for the 12th Five-Year Plan. "In the absence of a Five-Year Plan, the state cannot evaluate its progress," says Raghav Narsale, an economist with Focus India firm. "The plan is necessary to get maximum funds from the Centre," he adds. Nagpur BJP MLA Devendra Phadnavis claims: "In the past five years, I reminded them thrice about the FiveYear Plan but to no avail." According to Narsale, in the Five-Year Plan, the state cannot divert funds of one scheme to another whereas in yearly planning the funds can easily be diverted and the ministers have discre-

tionary powers over expenditures. "This leads to corruption," he says. Abhay Pethe, economics teacher at Mumbai University, says, "The plan is a general guideline these days. But Maharashtra's annual plans are small is size in proportion to its income." The state, in fact, has failed to utilise funds allocated in the annual plans since 2007. In 2007-08, the state's annual plan was Rs 20,200 crore, but it could use only Rs 19,422 crore; in 2008-09, funds were Rs 25,000 crore, but expenditure was Rs 22,870 crore; in 2009-10, funds were Rs 35,958 crore, while expenditure was Rs 27,731 crore; funds were Rs 37,916 crore in 2010-11, while expenditure was Rs 32,000 crore. In 2011-12, the annual plan is Rs 42,000 crore, but final figures of expenditure are yet to arrive. Reduced income has forced departments to cut expenditure on projects by 10 to 15 per cent. Pawar insists that the state is on the right path. "Our net domestic product is Rs 9,82,452 crore which is 24.7 per cent higher than the previous year. The per capita income is Rs 87,686 which is higher than the national figure of Rs 53,331. We are making overall progress," he says. by Kiran Tare
