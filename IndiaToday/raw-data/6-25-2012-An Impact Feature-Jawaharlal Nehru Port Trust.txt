JAWAHARLAL NEHRU PORT TRUST

Jawaharlal Nehru Port is the largest major port in India in terms of solid cargo handled. It has a market share of over 55% of the container movement for all the major ports in India and handles about half of the container movement from all the major and minor

ports in India combined. 2011-12 was a year ofrecords.
The Port handled 65.73 million tonnes in 2011-12: an all time record. The 4.32 million containers (TEUs) dealt with in 2011-12 was also a record. fNPCT, the container terminal directly operated by the Port Trust handled 1.03 million TEUs as against its original installed capacity of only 0.87 million TEUs. The qualitative performance criteria of 2011-12 too have broken records. The average pre-berthing time was reduced from 13 hours 40 minutes in 2010-11 to 8 hours 24 minutes in 2011-12. The turnaround time was reduced from 41.02 hours in 2010-11 to 36.00 hours in 2011-12. The average output per ship per berthed day increased to an all time high of 25,762 tonnes in 2011-12 as comparedto 24,849 in 2010-11.

Due to inadequate capacity, Jawaharlal Nehru Port was constrained to work at over 100% of its capacity as against the international norm of 60 to 70%. To remedy this, JNPT has embarked on a massive spree of expansion. A concession agreement for the 4lh terminal with a capacity of 4.8 million TEUs per annum (estimated to cost ? 8,500 crores currently) is about to be signed. A smaller quay extension project adding 0.8 million TEUs p.a. capacity is at the final stage of bidding. As the biggest container port in India and one of the top 25 in the world, Jawaharlal Nehru Port needs a channel deep enough for the largest container vessels. These should ideally call directly at JN Port without transshipment to smaller feeder vessels in ports like Singapore, Colombo, etc. Otherwise, Indian trade would have to incur the extra freight and transshipment charges amounting to hundreds of dollars per container. So, a project

estimated to cost ? 1571 crores for widening and deepening of the JN Port-Mumbai channel to 14 metres depth, is at the final stage of price bid. In addition to the above schemes costing over ? 12,000 crores due for execution in 2012-13 itself, many new initiatives have been taken from the last year for projects estimated to cost around ? 40,000 crores.  Additional container berths in Nhava possibly of 10 million TEUs per annum capacity (cost: around ? 25,000 crores) are under detailed feasibility study/design by M/s. Scott Wilson and M/s. Howe India Pvt. Ltd. The objective is to get approved the DPR by 2015 by the Govt. of India, complete international PPP bidding procedures by 2016 and finish construction/commission by 2020.  The second phase of dredging from 14 metres to 17 metres depth with considerable w i d e n i n g conforming to international PIANC standards is being designed and studies are undertaken by M/s. Tata Consulting Engineers with M/s. Ernst & Young. This project would start in

2014 and may cost roughly ? 5000 crores. This will enable calls by the biggest mother ships of even 18,000 TEU capacity, directly to JN Port. This dredging project is attempted to be executed for the first time globally as a public private partnership.  JN Port had converted its berths from general to container berths in view of growing demand for container handling. However, a huge potential demand exists for multi purpose berths, for which an international tender for engaging consultants is in process. The possibility of adding a capacity 50 million tonnes of general cargo per annum on a 3 km long quay is to be studied and detailed project report (DPR) prepared in a year.  A liquid terminal which could quadruple the current capacity is under consultancy for design and detailed project report with M/s. L&T Ramboll.  About 2750 acres of the Port's own land which does not have water frontage and cannot therefore be used for berths, has been earmarked for a port-based SEZ, of which the first phase of around 750 acres is being developed by the Port within 18 months. The approval from the Ministry of Commerce has been received and the Ministry of Shipping's clearance is awaited.  Both the modernisation of JNP Container Terminal with state-of-the-art cranes and deepening of the shallow water berth to accommodate container vessels are expected to be completed within a year adding 0.5 million TEUs p.a. capacity to the JNP Container Terminal.  The Port continues to maintain its unique status as a green port and to live up to its reputation as the recipient of several environment protection awards including the prestigious Indira Priyadarshini Vrikshamitra Award. With the objective of reducing its dependence on

conventional energy projects, wind-based and biomass plants for electricity are to be constructed with the technical help of M/s. C-WET under the Ministry of Power and M/s. ITCOT, (a PSUowned consultancy firm).  JN Port is the only major port conforming to ISO-9001:2008, ISO-27001:2005, ISO-14001:2004 (for environmental protection) and OHSAS 18001:2007 (for occupational health and safety).  A dedicated rail freight corridor which will enable double stacked container trains to move from JN Port to Delhi in 16-17 hours (as against 3-4 days now) is expected to be commissioned by March, 2017, as a measure to reduce cargo movement by road which consumes over five times the fuel as compared to transport by rail or water, as well as causing environmental pollution and social costs on account of loss of lives and maiming in road accidents. It is expected that by 2017, 60% of JN Port cargo would go by rail as against 20% now, saving precious fuel and reducing pollution as well as accidents on highways. The future cargo throughput of JN Port is planned to be transported to medium and long distances by train. JNPT is also in discussion with the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation for advice to set up a logistics park of around 200 acres to ensure seamless connectivity between its container terminals and the DFCC line (which comes inside JNPort). Thus, JNPT has taken all possible steps, particularly in the last year, to fulfill its role in achieving the targets of the Maritime Agenda 2020 and will go on to become one of the largest 12 ports of the world and the largest in South Asia by the end of the decade.
