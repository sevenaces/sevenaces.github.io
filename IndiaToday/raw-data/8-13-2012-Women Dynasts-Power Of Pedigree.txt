POWEROF PEDIGREE
Theirs is an elite sorority where the surname entitles membership. These MPs are not just Daughters and Wives (DAWs) but are articulate ambassadors of their lineage.

We are mothers. We can run a house as well as a country. A woman's silence is a sign of her power.

hen Harsimrat Kaur Badal, 46, was invited to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's dinner to meet the visiting American President Barack Obama, she wore her best silk sari for the occasion. The next day, she was besieged with hate mail. "You have made us proud by always wearing salwar kameez, yet when the time came to showcase our culture, you wore a sari," ranted one letter writer. The others were no different. For Harsimrat is no mere MP. As Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal's wife she is also the state's ambassador to the Capital. >> HARSIMRAT KAUR BADAL 46 SAD MP from Bathinda, Punjab Married to Sukhbir Badal, deputy chief minister, Punjab.They have three children, Harkirat, 17, Gurleen, 13, and Anantvir, 8. Education Diploma in textile design from South Delhi Polytechnic for Women. The style As a schoolgirl, she wore jeans and skirts. Now, it's strictly salwar kameez with a dupatta draped over her head. The cause Women empowerment. She runs an NGO, Nanhi Chhaan, to campaign against female foeticide.Also runs old age homes. She uses her MP fund to run 70 sewing centres in villages in Punjab. The resolution Won't get into any more shouting matches in Parliament. She was shouted down when she raised 1984 riots in her maiden speech in 2009 and recently when she asked for more water for Punjab.

Perhaps that is the reason why two of her closest friends in Parliament happen to be daughters of former chief ministers: Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule, 43, and M. Karunanidhi's daughter, Kanimozhi, 44. A third friend is Priya Dutt, 46, the late Sunil Dutt's daughter. These are the DAWs (Daughters and Wives) of politicians. It's an elite sorority where the surname entitles membership. Other members are P.A. Sangma's daughter Agatha, 32, and Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple, 35, who will be making her debut this Parliament session. The soft-spoken, convent-educated Dimple Yadav is a refreshing change from the usual brand of cow-belt politiRAVI S SAHANI / www.indiatodayimages.com

cians. Her presence in Parliament is a testimony to her husband's power. He waited three years to avenge her humiliating defeat to the Congress in a 2009 Lok Sabha by-election from Firozabad. In June 2012, soon after Akhilesh won the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, Dimple contested the Kannauj by-election. This time, no party dared take on the Samajwadi Party. She won uncontested. Little wonder then, when asked how much she'd rate her husband's performance as chief minister, she says 8/10 without batting an eyelid. Power has given the couple confidence. Recently, at a function when he heard his wife being described as a combination of beauty and brains, Akhilesh leaned across and whispered loudly, "Didn't you lose your first election?" They are all fairly new to Parliament but they are certainly not new to power. They've exercised it, albeit second hand, through their powerful surnames. "The benchmark of my politics is that my father-in-law (Parkash Singh Badal) should not be ashamed of me. People should not say Badal sahib ki daughter-in-law and shake their heads," says Harsimrat. But, like any good MP, that doesn't stop her from wrangling something extra from the government. It was at her initiative that Parkash announced the recruitment of women in Punjab Police. She is also proud of the fact that Sukhbir revived kabaddi by holding an international competition in 2011. "Of the 17 teams, four were women's teams but the prize money was Rs 2 crore for the men and Rs 50,000 for women. I fought with Sukhbir against this bias. He said he'll increase it this year, and I'll keep fighting till he does," she says. In private it's Sukhbir, but in public she calls him Sukhbirji as that's how Punjabi men are traditionally addressed by their wives. "He loves it," says Harsimrat, who is never seen without her head covered with a dupatta. The feisty Punjabi doesn't hesitate to fight when the cause is right. She raised the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in her maiden speech in December 2009. "No

One person she can't say no to "I can say no to him (Akhilesh) but not to my father-in-law (Mulayam)." Trophy win Akhilesh took it as a personal insult when Congress defeated Dimple in the 2009 Firozabad by-election.When she won unopposed from Kannauj this June, it was the `raj tilak'to his Assembly win."Jo baat adhoori rah gayi thi poori ho gayi (what was left unfinished got done)," he says with a satisfied smile.

use waiting for laws to be implemented. I am the best platform to spread my social message and make what difference I can," she says. Supriya Sule has recently been appointed as the head of NCP's newly created youth wing for women. "We promote education and health issues, educate women about their rights," she says. Some see this as a sign that Pawar is grooming his daughter to play a more meaningful role in his party. "My father doesn't give advice generously," retorts Sule. When asked about dynasty in politics, Kanimozhi laughed and said, "Isn't that why you're doing the story?" Before she became an MP, Kanimozhi occasionally disagreed with her father's politics. She did not endorse the party line against actor Kushboo for her remarks on pre-marital sex. "When I had the liberty to disagree with my father, I did," she says. Kanimozhi has seen the darker side of the power equation when she was sent to jail in 2011 for her alleged role in the 2G scam. "Somewhere, it makes you stronger," she says, about her time behind bars. "You are blind to a lot of things because you are com>> SUPRIYA SULE 43 NCP MP from Baramati, Maharashtra Sharad Pawar's daughter. Husband Sadanand is a businessman.

She moved a private members'bill against making suicide a crime.

fortable in life. But once you are out there, you get to confront a lot of limitations--your own, and of the people and things around you. Emotionally you become stronger." With her brothers squabbling for power in Tamil Nadu, Kanimozhi was sent to Delhi to be DMK's national face. "I don't think it's healthy for one person to be the face of the party," she says. Curiously, her stature within her party has increased after her jail stint, as many see her as a scapegoat. Dressed in cottons, hair clips, nose studs, gold bangles and silver toe-rings, they walk confidently to Parliament, carrying soft leather handbags. But their best accessory is the aura of confidence that is subconsciously conferred on them through their lineage. "I am a bit nervous about speaking in Parliament," admits Dimple with a shy smile. But she also knows that when she gets up to make her maiden speech, father>> AGATHA SANGMA 32 NCP MP from Tura, Meghalaya Education MA in environmental management, Nottingham University, UK. The cause Her father. He jeopardised her position as a Union minister when she supported his campaign for president which ran against her party line.

in-law Mulayam, with the might of his 22 MPs, will be there to support her. What is interesting is that with the exception of Agatha, they are all young mothers. When they're not playing politics, both Akhilesh and Dimple play football with their three kids; Harsimrat and Sukhbir's latest challenge is to help their eight-year-old son with his pet project--making a car that can fly. Motherhood for them is a fine balance of Lego and legislation. Says Sule, "If I have to communicate with my son, then I must to know what's happening with Manchester United. We went to see the Indian Grand Prix last year and it's just watching cars whizzing around. At the end, I had to ask him, who won?" Priya Dutt perhaps speaks for all of them when she says, "Whatever I achieve in my political life will mean nothing if my home front is in disarray." It was when Harsimrat saw cartoons lampooning politicians in her children's textbooks that she raised the issue in Parliament. The media mocked her for lacking a sense of humour but she says, "The issues I raised got diverted. Aren't such cartoons weakening democracy? You have to show the good side of politicians as well." Dutt, who inherited her father's constituency after his death in 2005, says. "I remember asking my father, why politics? You already have a name. He told me he was using this as a platform to help people." Following her father's politics may not be as beneficial for another political daughter. Agatha may soon lose her ministry for choosing her father's politics over her party line. She supported Sangma's recent bid for president of India even though he was not NCP's official candidate. Their presence in Parliament is clearly a show of power flexing by their fathers and husbands. But these young women have not restricted themselves to an ornamental role. They've become articulate ambassadors for their political dynasties. As usual, it is the candid Harsimrat who has the last word, saying with a laugh: "My father-in-law rarely speaks, my husband is conservative, and I can't stop talking."
