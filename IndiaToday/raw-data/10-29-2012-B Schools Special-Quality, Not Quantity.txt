Quality, Not QUANTITY
It takes a lot to get to the top but more to stay there. Business schools in India must focus on producing global leaders, not degree-holders.

HOW FACTUALAND PERCEPTUAL SURVEYS DIFFER
PERCEPTION SURVEY Respondents are asked which institute they "perceive" is best. These perceptions are converted into scores, and added to get the overall score. FACTUAL SURVEY A questionnaire is sent to institutes seeking data on faculty, facilities, placements, salaries, fees and other parameters. Scores are awarded based on the data, which are added to get the overall score. WHAT BT HAS DONE Both surveys have their shortcomings. But by combining their results, these are largely overcome. Business Today conducted a factual survey, followed by a perceptual survey. The scores of both were added to get the overall ranking.

n August, a survey of India's top 100 business schools, which was conducted by Web portal MBAuniverse.com and assessment company MeritTrac, revealed what many employers had known for a while--a majority of MBA graduates in India are not employable. The survey, which covered 2,264 MBA students from 29 cities, showed that outside the top 25 business schools, the remaining provided only 21 per cent of their graduates with a job. The employability of MBA graduates from schools ranked between 26 and 100 was actually worse in 2012 (21 per cent) than in 2007 (25 per cent), when the previous survey was conducted. The number of MBA seats in the country has gone up from just under 95,000 to 350,000 in the same period. The quantity of seats increased at an annual growth rate of 30 per cent. The quality of education apparently did not keep pace. It suffers from the same malaise as much of India's higher education sector. While supply has risen to meet the fast-growing demand, lack of quality control has meant India has thousands of youngsters armed

with a degree but with nowhere to go. Where management education in India actually differs from the broader higher education space is in the topnotch quality of the best institutions. IIM, Ahmedabad, which tops the Business Today rankings in 2012, features in the Top 10 of the very prestigious Financial Times (FT) rankings of the world's best business schools. IIM, Ahmedabad is ranked second in the Asia-Pacific region by the QS 200 rankings of global business schools in 2012. The QS rankings feature six Indian B-schools in the top 36 from Asia-Pacific, which are also in the top 200 in the world. The Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, ranks 20 in the FT rankings for 2012. In comparison, rarely does any Indian university, barring perhaps a

solitary IIT, make it to the top 200 in any credible rankings of global universities. That India has even a few management institutes which are on a par with the best in the world is big encouragement. So the institutes that lag behind have their role models at home, which have been able to prosper despite all the constraints that India lays down. The purpose of surveys such as the Business Today B-Schools rankings is to spur competition among institutions. It is competition, and not the heavy-handed government regulation, which will ultimately ensure higher quality standards across institutions in the country. The stakes for India are high. India's comparative advantage, at least over its closest competitor, China, is in its knowledge economy. At the moment, China is marginally ahead of India in the quality of its top management institutes. In the FT rankings for 2012, five Chinese management schools feature in the top 100 compared with India's two. In the QS rank-

ings for 2012, the honours are evenly shared with six institutions each from India and China in the top 200. India must do better. It needs to power ahead of China in the quality of its skilled manpower. Some institutes are attempting innovative approaches. Says Mukul P. Gupta, director of Management Development Institute, "We have structured our curriculums to meet with the demands and requirements of the industry." Speaking of the changes at the Institute of Management Technology (IMT), Arun Mohan Sherry, director, joint admissions committee, says, "One of the things unique to us is our two-

year global MBA. Unlike other B-schools that facilitate student exchanges for a short duration, IMT's course sends a student for one year to study in Dubai, a hub of trade and industry." It is estimated that by 2020, emerging economies will contribute 50 per cent of the world's GDP. They will contribute more than 66 per cent to the global growth rate. China and India will constitute a lion's share of the emerging economies pie. It is inevitable that global business will increasingly focus its efforts on fast-growing emerging economies at the expense of stagnant markets in the US, Europe and Japan. By 2050, it is estimated that India and China will be the two largest economies in the world, with India's possibly larger than China. If that trend were to translate into reality--possible only if the Government of India does not come in the way--India, and China, will become the hub of global economic activity. Indians and Chinese will own a greater share of global businesses; they

already own some globally renowned brands such as Jaguar and Lenovo. The question is whether businesses will be managed by Indians, Chinese, Americans or Europeans. India has the numbers to churn out a majority of the world's managers by 2050. But it doesn't have the institutional capability, unless a dramatic turnaround is achieved in the next decade. Of course, some of the most talented Indians will also manage key global businesses. They already do: Anshu Jain at Deutsche Bank and Indra Nooyi at Pepsi to name a few. The challenge is to produce many more such outstanding individuals. We should aim for a scenario that in 10 years from now, when an Indian is appointed CEO of a global major, it doesn't make news. Why? Because there already will be so many of them. Only then will India truly arrive as a knowledge economy. It is now up to the hundreds of India's business schools to rise to the challenge.

THE BASE AND THE WEIGHTS
How the issue of high scores by a few respondents was addressed

A

n institute becomes a national brand once it is known to be good, particularly by students and recruiters well beyond the area where it is located. Again, it may seem that if a few people know about a B-school, its perception score would be low. But what if the few people rate it high? Such scores skew survey results. This sometimes results in little-known B-schools shooting up the rankings. `Awareness' is an intangible and difficult factor to handle, especially in a perception survey of 205 B-schools. To address this problem and create a level-playing field, we introduced an `awareness deflator' in the perception survey.

This is how it worked: The 205 B-schools were divided into 10 panels. Each panel had 120 respondents called the base, all of whom rated the schools they knew of. B-schools rated by 40 or more respondents (one-third of the sample) were assigned a weight of 1, so their perception scores were multiplied by 1. B-schools rated by 30 to 39 respondents were given a weight of 0.9, so their perception scores were multiplied by 0.9, deflating their total score by a small margin. For 20 to 29 respondents, the weight was 0.8; and for B-schools that were rated by fewer than 20 respondents, the weight was 0.7. This approach helped us address the awareness issue.
