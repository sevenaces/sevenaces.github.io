STYLE DRIVE
The Ducati Diavel remains one of the top-selling models even though it was lauched two years ago, in 2010. This beefy machine with a commanding presence weighing 207 kg is still agile and free flowing--signature characteristics of the Italian brand. The name is inspired by the word devil in the Bolognese dialect. The design team responsible for this make says that they have tried to create a machine that is reminiscent of an athlete on the starting block, with regards to their frontal design for the bike. Therefore, the bike does not represent anger as much as it exudes readiness, dominance and confidence, bordering on superiority with features such as a massive 240 section rear tyre that encases stunning custom 14-spoke wheels with machine finished detailing and 162 horse power. This Ducati has a hands-free ignition where an electronic key in a rider's pocket communicates with the motorcycle from a distance of two meters through a designated code.
