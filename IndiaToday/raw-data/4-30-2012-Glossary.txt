GLOSSARY

SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS
USP
Comeback launch vehicle for Karisma Kapur, who looks sharp, especially in a red dress with her leg stuck out like Angelina Jolie.

Regardless of IPL, Bollywood is going in for the kill. Here are three new films which will hit the screens this summer.

ANGER MANAGEMENT
Southern actor Ram Charan Teja, 27, will play the role of Vijay in the remake of the 1973 classic Zanjeer, essayed in the original by Amitabh Bachchan. Son of Telugu superstar Chiranjeevi, Teja made his debut in 2007 with the Telugu film Chirutha.Teja is still not fluent in Hindi, so instead of too many angry dialogues, there will be much brooding silence.Ah! Action will indeed speak louder than words.

NEW INNINGS
Ajinkya Rahane, 23, stole the show at the start of the ongoing IPL Season 5. The Rajasthan Royals batsman scored 103 runs off just 60 balls against Royal Challengers Bangalore at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore on April 15. Rahane dedicated this feat to his parents, who he says had to make many sacrifices to nurture his ambitions of becoming a cricketer. Rahane has a first class batting average of 68.47, the highest among the current cricketers in the country. "All the attention is motivating. However, it will be a huge challenge to maintain the consistency," he says. Atta boy!

ANAND

GOING PLACES
Southern actor Priya Anand, 25, is only five films old. Having worked mostly with debutant directors, Anand hasn't had much luck down south. Finally, the newbie has secured a break with a meaty role in Bollywood. Anand will be seen alongside comeback queen Sridevi in R. Balki's English Vinglish. She plays Radha, Sridevi's niece who helps her with her English. Anand made her debut in the Tamil film Vaamanan in 2009 and played supporting roles in films such as Leader and 180. A communications and journalism graduate from University at Albany, State University of New York, she returned to India in 2008 and tried her luck at modelling. Patience does pay off.

DRAMA QUEEN
Patricia Arquette's claim to fame would have to be her marriages to Hollywood actors Nicolas Cage--six years--and Thomas Jane, five years. Now is her chance to do something different. The 44-year-old American actor has bagged the lead role in the European production My Friend Vijay. Directed by Belgian director Sam Garbarski, the film is about a man who is mistakenly pronounced dead and decides to attend his own funeral disguised as a Sikh. Arquette plays the wife who falls for the Indian avatar of her supposedly dead husband. Charming!

What's not The songs composed by music director Pritam. Hope they're original.

VAJPAI

ON A HIGH
In 2011, Arjun Vajpai, 18, scaled Mount Lhotse, the fourth highest peak in the world. This year, the youngest mountaineer is part of a four-member team called the Delhi Daredevils Superfans, which grooms the daredevils and keeps them from cracking under pressure on the field. Versatility at its best.
