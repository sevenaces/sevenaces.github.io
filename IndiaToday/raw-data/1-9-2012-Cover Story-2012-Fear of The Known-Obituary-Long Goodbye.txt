LONG GOODBYE
Each year is a reminder of mortality but 2011 saw our most cherished cultural icons fade into memory

BHIMSEN JOSHI
1922-2011 by Amjad Ali Khan, musician Pursuit of Passion He knew my
father Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan. I used to take part in their conversations. What I always admired in him was his singleminded approach, how as a young boy of 11, he rebelled against his father's wish to follow in his footsteps as an educationist. Instead, he would join bhajan singers passing by the house. The turning point came when he heard Ustad Abdul Karim Khan's thumri Piya bin nahin awat chain. He left home in search of a guru. He travelled in trains without a ticket and would sing for passengers and ticket-checking staff. He finally reached Gwalior where he started learning from Pandit Krishnarao Shankar Pandit. In His Honour It was a great moment when we presented him the Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan Memorial Award. Though he had evolved his own style of singing, he would often say that he continued to derive inspiration from Abdul Karim Khan and Sawai Gandharva. His was a living example of simplicity and humility. Communalism Combat A year before Babri Masjid demolition, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, Ustad Aminuddin Dagar and I performed in Ayodhya. We jointly appealed to everyone to let sanity prevail as the masjid is more a historical than religious place.

SHAMMI KAPOOR
1931-2011 by Asha Parekh, actor Rhythm Divine I first met
Shammi Kapoor during the making of Dil Deke Dekho (1959). There was music and rhythm in his body. He never relied on a dance director. He would make his own steps and dance in ways no one could ever copy. In Full Bloom While shooting for Dil Deke Dekho in Ranikhet, he spotted a beautiful plum tree in full bloom. He cut a branch filled with white flowers and placed it behind me in a scene and it looked so wonderful. Fun on the Run We would check out the crowd that used to come to watch us shoot. We would watch pretty people in the crowd and exchange notes.

M.F. HUSAIN
1915-2011 by Krishen Khanna, artist Art of Popularity Husain and his family spent their early years in Badar Bagh in Bombay. His imagination overflowed and his paintings got bigger and bigger. His life was free-flowing. His natural charm coupled with a remarkable talent gave him easy access to every stratum of society. He realised that for his work to have a larger reach, he would have to be outward looking. He saw no contradiction between the demands of his art and his public persona.

"WE INDIANS HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOUR LEFT IN US ONCE WE PASS THE AGE OF 25."
Once Upon a Time The very last
time he came to see me, he viewed three of his paintings hung side by side. He faced them and then fell silent, probably seeing the different periods of his life from 1951 to 1961. He finally commented on one of the paintings done in 1956. "I am glad I did not pursue that direction. If I had, I would've become an introvert." He urged me several times to visit him in Dubai, "before time runs out". And it so did.

Mentor to Many It was Husain
who inducted me into The Progressive Artists' Group, enabling many fertile exchanges amongst ourselves. He was also responsible for bringing my work to the notice of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research which was building an important collection of art. He was a friend of Dr Homi Bhabha and he sold him my first painting. I was in Madras at the time. Husain sent a long telegram congratulating me.

JAGJIT SINGH
1941-2011 by Talat Aziz, singer Lost in Music I first met Jagjit
Singh in 1975 at Ravindra Bharathi in Hyderabad. My father had taken me there to meet the legend who was on his maiden visit to the city. Jagjit saheb very sportingly sat down next to me and said, "Don't worry! You sing and I will hold the mike." I kept on singing and forgot that he was invited for lunch. He laughed it off. In His Honour In 1979 when we started planning my debut album, I called up Jagjit saheb and asked whether he would compose music for the album. He called me to his house. I requested him to select all ghazals. He agreed instantly. The album was released on February 8, 1980, his birthday. It was a huge success. Last Hurrah On his 70th birthday this year, he was in an unusually festive mood. On stage, when I was singing a ghazal with which he had launched me, he took the mike and sang a classical bandish. He then asked Kunal Ganjawala, Roop Kumar Rathod and Lalit Pandit to join us and soon the mehfil turned into a fun evening with Lalit joining with Munni badnaam hui and Jagjit saheb dancing away. It was probably the first time after the tragedy in his life that he let go in public and we all enjoyed. Little did we know that this was his goodbye to our world.

PRAMOD PUSHKARNA

1926-2011 by Sai Paranjpye, filmmaker The Perfectionist Bhupenda's precision while working was inspiring, he would always read the script, understand the film, the situation in which the song was being set and then go on to make the right tune. He was one of those people who can be easily called perfectionists in the true sense. I loved his folk and tribal melodies. Priceless Artist The first time I met him was in the early 1990s. He agreed to work with me on my film Papeeha (1993) at a nominal fee without even an iota of hesitation. I was indebted to him for life. Up Close After the success of Papeeha, I approached him for Saaz in 1996. The theme of the film required him to be filmed in the song. It was delightful shooting him on camera.

MANSOOR ALI KHAN PATAUDI
1941-2011 by Bishen Singh Bedi, cricketer

Country First Tiger Pataudi was
the best thing that happened to Indian cricket from the time the country got Test status. He was a Nawab yet humble to the core. He was the first captain to drill Indianness into the dressing room. He didn't look through a regional prism: "We're not playing for Bombay, Delhi, Madras or Mysore... We are playing for India...For goodness' sake think India." These words are still fresh in my memory. I haven't seen a more fair sporting icon.

Captain Courageous We were deprived of a 100 per cent fit Tiger as a car accident in England had damaged his right eye permanently. And yet he overcame a massive handicap. During a camp at NDA, Khadakvasla, Tiger clocked 10.6 seconds in the 100metre dash. His swiftness was phenomenal. Going for a draw was alien to his mental makeup. There were better all-round fielders perhaps but give me Tiger in the covers and I'll take on any batsman.

SATHYA SAI BABA
1926-2011 by Shiv Kumar Sharma, musician God,Not Godman My relationship with Sathya Sai Baba is 35 years old. Initially, I was a sceptic but after I met him I realised that his love was unconditional and he didn't differentiate between a king and a pauper. I have played for him many times and experienced his omnipresent power. In fact, he gave me a ring that I always wear. I used to share my innermost thoughts with his portrait. And invariably, when I'd meet him, he would tell me what I was going through in life. He was an incarnation and not a godman.

Poor Man's Friend He propagated social welfare. He was always thinking of how to improve the life of others, specially the downtrodden. The projects his trust undertook are proof of this. He was ever-giving. His teachings were valuebased with no bias towards any religion. Heart of Gold Once when I met him I presented him a blank cheque and asked him to fill in whatever amount he wanted. He said, "Tumhara sangeet hi vishwa sewa hai (Your contribution to music is enough)." I was speechless.

"I AM CERTAINLY NOT A LEGEND. I AM A WORKING MAN."

DEVANAND
1923-2011 by Shatrughan Sinha, actor Forever Young Though he
insisted on being called Dev, young actors wouldn't find it an appropriate way to address him. And no one would dare call him `Dev uncle' as he would take offence. Humble Hero He never overshadowed young actors. In the film Shareef Budmaash (1973), I had a fight scene with Dev saab in which I had to put a knife to his neck. In those days big stars would edit out such scenes. But he didn't do it; he was a natural scene stealer, he wasn't threatened by anyone. Sense of Style I was introduced to Dev saab in the 1960s. He was impressed with my style of holding the cigarette and my voice. He said, "This boy has a lot of confidence." Hearing that from a superstar I worshipped was the defining moment at the beginning of my career.

"PASS YOUR DAYS IN SONG. LET YOUR WHOLE LIFE BE A SONG." MARIO MIRANDA
1926-2011 by Bevinda Collaco, writer A Beautiful Mind Mario was a during the day and draw
handsome absent-minded man, surrounded by humans and animals that loved him, accepting that love; there, but not quite there, because he was already planning more beautiful and quirky elements to add to his creation. The Making of Miranda Mario would take the one thing that caught his attention that. From those sketch books grew the Mario Miranda we came to know. Fighter Till the End He had been ailing for two years stricken with Parkinson's and could not do the one thing he loved--draw. But he loved music and was seen at all the concerts in Goa until a couple of days before he decided to rest.

ARJUN SINGH
1930-2011
He epitomised loyalty to the Nehru-Gandhi family, albeit in fits and starts. Arjun Singh served as Madhya Pradesh chief minister, governor of Punjab, Congress Working Committee president, and Union minister.

ELIZABETH TAYLOR
1932-2011
The violet eyes, the spotless skin, the pouty lips and raven hair. Elizabeth Taylor was an icon of glamour and beauty, a modern-day Cleopatra who lived life on her own terms. That included eight marriages, including to Richard Burton twice. And fighting AIDS when no one wanted to shake hands with the afflicted.

STEVE JOBS
1955-2011
The guru of design. Always one step ahead of the competition. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc, threw up products that challenged the limits of imagination. The MacBook, the iPad and the iPhone were all driven by a passion for perfection. Jobs's passion also stemmed from an urge to make the world better place. The urge didn't dim one bit even when he battled pancreatic cancer.

AMYWINEHOUSE
1983-2011
Headlines screamed her excesses. She was in and out of rehab. Amy Winehouse left behind music that's simply ethereal; the clutch of Grammys against her name a testament to her songwriting prowess. In life, she was a goddess; in death she was a story foretold.

HARGOBIND KHORANA
1922-2011
An inspirational life, if there was one. Hargobind Khorana was born into the family of a patwari (village clerk) in present-day Pakistan and homeschooled by his father before going on to study and teach at some of the best institutes in Europe and the US. For his work on genes, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1968.

VACLAV HAVEL
1936-2011
It took a poet-politician to spearhead a Velvet Revolution that ended Communism in Czechoslovakia in 1989. Vaclav Havel became the country's last president and oversaw its 1993 break-up into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. As the Czech Republic's first president, his steady hand steered the nation to democracy and a free-market economy.

CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS
1949-2011
Confrontational. Provocative. But someone no one could ignore. A self-defined radical, journalist Christopher Hitchens championed the New Atheism movement. He courted controversy with his potshots at Mother Teresa.
