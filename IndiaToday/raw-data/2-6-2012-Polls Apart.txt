he thunders,"Hum jawab denge (We will give a reply).""Aggression works in the cow belt," says a Congressman. From using phrases like `Main thode logon se mila (I met a few people)' , he's now using colloquial words like bhadaak se (suddenly). Sleeves rolled up,`Rahul bhaiya' is wooing the UP-wallah. It's a choreographed look, sharply different from 2007 when he claimed he had no identity other than that of an Indian. In 2012,

AKHILESH ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL

MAYAWATI An ad agency hired in November to sell her to voters suggested that Mayawati needs to dissociate the Bahujan Samaj Party from the perception that it is corrupt. She immediately sacked over a dozen ministers. She was also urged to connect with the youth. Mayawati is yet to hit the campaign trail but much before poll dates were announced, hoardings listing the government's achievements sprang up all over the state. Accessories None. The handbags have vanished. Now wears stoles with dark overcoats. Campaign call Mein Dalit ki beti hun (I am a Dalit's daughter). RAHUL GANDHI The look is that of an angry young man."Not angry, aggressive," corrects Congress leader Digvijaya Singh. The schoolboy glasses and dimpled smile have been replaced by an angry frown as

he has learnt to play the caste card. "Sam Pitroda is a Kurmi," he told people in Gorakhpur recently. But local candidates still have a grouse. They want him to talk local issues. That's the kind of jawab they want. Accessories A carefully cultivated beard and his grandmother's photograph on campaign posters. Bring it on Ek aur phek do (Hit me again). It's his Dabangg act.

AKHILESH YADAV Thanks to its young president, the Samajwadi Party (SP) has finally entered the age of computers. Akhilesh Yadav is the poster boy for SP's image makeover. It is he who coined the current SP slogan,`Umeed ki cycle (cycle of hope)' . The party's star campaigner is rather proud of the SP's somewhat cheeky new advertisement. It shows an elephant plodding along. Suddenly, a

cycle bell rings and the elephant is overtaken by an SP worker in a red cap riding a cycle. No words are needed. Clearly, a sense of humour is a recent Samajwadi import. What old timers miss is his father's gravitas. Mulayam Singh Yadav's campaign during the last Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in 2007 is now part of SP folklore. Asking for the re-election of a lackadaisical MLA, Mulayam had said,"Saare saal aap saanp ko marte ho. Lekin Nag Panchami ke din usko doodh pilaate ho (You beat a snake all year round but feed it milk on the occasion of Nag Panchami). Spare him on voting day. I will make sure he works after that."This kind of down-to-earth pragmatism is not something Akhilesh will ever find on his laptop. It comes with experience. Accessories Akhilesh's iPad, BlackBerry and the red party cap. Trademark talk Who says the Samajwadi Party is anti-computer?

Senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has done it again. Known for his controversial sound bites, he has come up with another googly. He says the word KASAB clubs the party's principal opponents. KA stands for Congress, SA for Samajwadi Party and B for Bahujan Samaj Party. Naqvi quips that Uttar Pradesh voters would send KASAB to the gallows after the polls. Somewhat gallows humour but it seems to have struck at chord at BJP headquarters.

S.C. Mishra's LucknowBahraich-Balrampur roadshow is hitting the right notes. The Bahujan Samaj Party's (BSP) star campaigner is also the party's Brahmin face. A Mishra show begins with his pet theme, the DalitBrahmin winning combination. He then tears into rival parties before signing off with an appeal to voters to use their mind. The slogans at his rally are equally catchy. "Batan dabega haathi par, baaki sab baisakhi par (Voters will press the BSP button and leave other parties on crutches)."A good lawyer always knows how to best present his case.

INTERVIEW

Naresh Gujral
tried hard. Also, there will be a major shift of the Dalit vote away from Congress. Some will go to the BSP and some to us. Q. Why will the Dalits vote for you? A. We began the Shagun scheme where a Dalit girl gets Rs 5,000 upon marriage. We have promised to raise the amount to Rs 12,000 in our election manifesto. If there is an unemployed graduate from BPL families, we are promising Rs 1,000 a month for three years for him to enrol in some skill management course. Q. How is the BJP faring? A. I had thought they were a spent force. Not anymore. Maybe it's the Anna (Hazare) effect. There is anger against the Congress over price hike and corruption. I see BJP getting 13-14 seats. Q. How come the SAD has suddenly discovered laptops? A. We want to make Punjab an IT hub. Look at our campaign. Unlike others who are running to Dera chiefs, we are talking development, not religion. We are talking tomorrow's language.

Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Gujral talks to Senior Editor PRIYA SAHGAL about why he thinks the SAD will prove all opinion polls wrong and sweep the Punjab polls. Q. What do you predict? A. We are winning comfortably. Our coalition will win 65-70 seats. There is a great deal of appreciation for the development work done by the government. There is a feeling that the government has
