FIO - A ROMANTIC JOURNEY
ts two years and Fio has gained a reputation worth an experience with ;ourmetfood and an ambience unparallel in the city replete with the right kind of expertise and passion. No wonder it gets rave reviews from the foodies. Vineet Wadhwa pledges to constantly evolve his menu and his recent winter menu befits the fine taste with enhanced twists, thankfully with chef's who eat VINEET WADHWA Italian with pride and have lived major part DIRECTOR of their lives in Italy. Interestingly the Fio kitchen has two distinct cuisines - The Country Italian and Rustic Pan Indian. The Indian scores with Vineet's personal passion, demolishing the myth of parallel positioning Indian with Italian. A large unbeaten alfresco with an equally large covered area can accommodate... The Huge. Hence, the event calendar at Fio is all full - coming forth this Valentines is the Red Feathers Valentines with Manta Sidhu and her troupe embrassingthe romantic music lover with varied musical nuances

- that is natural to heart and open in expressions. Replete with an ambience doused in Red and tickled with Red Feathers, Red Roses & Red Strawberry Champagne. The buffet is coy & feminine with a dainty spread. To fall in love at Fio and with Fio is inevitable.
