he Prime Minister's communications adviser, Pankaj Pachauri, chose to remain, quite inexplicably, incommunicado for the press delegation accompanying Manmohan Singh on his historic trip to Myanmar capital Nay Pyi Taw, the first visit by an Indian prime minister in 25 years. Pachauri did not interact with the media on the PM's special flight. He missed the foreign secretary's press conference at the conclusion of the Prime Minister's talks with his Myanmarese counterpart. He was not even seen in the hotel at which the media was staying. Little wonder that the Prime Minister's media image is taking a battering.

issa Kursi Ka continues to evolve in strange dimensions in Congress politics. Rahul Gandhi's designated place at the celebratory UPA dinner on May 22 was beside Manmohan Singh. In a public snub, the heir left that chair empty and chose to sit with Mummy. This is the second recent snub for Manmohan. Sonia Gandhi accepted the lunch invitation for visiting Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari but stayed away, claiming sudden illness.

GOWDA

arnataka Chief Minister D. V. Sadananda Gowda has an odd sense of humour. Gowda, who went on an inspection of the Beggars' Rehabilitation Home in Bangalore, was impressed with a woman inmate's mathematical abilities; she was working on a complex sum. Gowda, in his usual jocular style, said: "You people are much better than our MLAs." Plus, unlike MLAs, they don't watch porn.

GOLD RUSH

hrottled at home, Indian entrepreneurs are making a beeline for natural resources outside. A high-powered business delegation accompanying the Prime Minister to Myanmar was largely made up

of entrepreneurs looking for resources. Jubilant co-CEO Hari Bhartia firmed up an agreement to explore a new onshore oil block. Naveen Jindal, CEO of Jindal Steel and Power, openly expressed frustration at India having "missed the bus" in Myanmar, with an obvious reference to China's aggressive investments. Sunil Mittal was more optimistic. Myanmar's mobile phone network is underdeveloped--there is no international roaming facility, for example. After Africa, it may be Myanmar next for Mittal.

HOSTILE FRIEND

M

inister of State for Home Jitendra Singh should stick to what he knows best--shadowing Rahul Gandhi. His public utterances can be embarrassing. On May 27, even as Manmohan Singh was in Myanmar, he called it a "hostile" country. He was in Meghalaya to review the security situation in the North-east. Myanmar, he said, was one of the "so-called friendly countries" which funds anti-India elements and fans unrest in the region.

ssam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi keeps A his slights subtle. When Congress President Sonia Gandhi visited the state on May 26 for the first anniversary celebrations of his government, he ensured that General Secretary Digvijaya Singh did not find a place on the dais with Sonia. Gogoi believes Singh has been fomenting dissidence against him and wanted to send him a signal.

SUMMER HOLIDAY
f you can't beat them, make them join you. Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has found a novel way to enjoy a summer break. Make that breaks. He has scheduled all future monthly meetings of the Cabinet in isolated, faraway locations across the state."This week I take the Cabinet to Tangdhar (near the Line of Control) in north Kashmir. Once a month we will meet in a remote part of the state... Gurez, Machil and Keran," Abdullah tweeted on May 27. His supporters say the initiative is a response to criticism regarding uneven distribution of government monies for development of infrastructure in Jammu & Kashmir's inaccessible areas. But we know better. The travel time will allow him to tweet and use BBM more.

olkata may have gone blue, but Lucknow is reverting to khaki. The Samajwadi Party government has decided to change the colour of traffic constables' uniform from blue to khaki, at a cost of Rs 55 lakh. The Uttar Pradesh traffic police had an all-white uniform till April 1, 2008. After that, the BSP government ordered that the white trousers be replaced by blue, the party colour. The cap, belt and jacket were also blue. Guess political symbolism comes at a price.

POLICEMEN IN THEIR OLD UNIFORM

aving been forced to surrender her stake in the defunct Kochi IPL team, Sunanda Pushkar has accepted the slightly less onerous responsibility of supporting Shah Rukh Khan's Kolkata Knight Riders. On May 27, Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor tweeted a picture of wife Sunanda in a KKR T-shirt with the legend `champion' emblazoned on it. He added that she had been extremely confident of the team's victory. Maybe she can use her influence to get Tharoor a Lok Sabha ticket from Kolkata next time.
