TOOTHLESS WATCH DOGS
The office of lokayukta exists in only 19 states. Most lack basic infrastructure and adequate staff, let alone punitive powers.
By Sowmya Aji

hile the Lokpal Bill for a Central anti-corruption watchdog is battling birth pangs and threatens to go the Women's Reservation Bill way, the lokayukta, the state-level ombudsman, is being slowly ground to dust by politicians. Only 19 states have instituted the office, most of which are in a moribund state. A politically conscious state such as Tamil Nadu, which routinely sees the Opposition levelling corruption charges at the incumbent government, has successfully evaded it citing the federal structure of our polity. Success

stories are just a handful: Kerala, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. Even there, the lokayuktas are severely hobbled by the lack of prosecution powers, basic infrastructure and staff. In Karnataka, politicians have conveniently sat on the appointment of a new lokayukta after Justice N. Santosh Hegde's activism put then chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa and then tourism minister G. Janardhan Reddy behind bars. The sorry state of lokayuktas across the country suggests a deliberate attempt to undermine the institution. Sample West Bengal, Gujarat and Karnataka. All three have lokayukta acts, but no one is holding the post. The

West Bengal lokayukta office, Bhabani Bhavan in Kolkata, is manned by two persons, Suman Halder and Sourin Brahmachari, both Group D staff. Gujarat didn't have a lokayukta for eight years from 2003 until Governor Kamla Beniwal, a UPA appointee, issued a suo motu order on August 26, 2011, to appoint Justice R.A. Mehta to the post. The Narendra Modi government immediately contested it, saying the governor's move was unconstitutional, but the Gujarat High Court has upheld the move. Even in Karnataka, said to have one of the strongest lokayukta acts in the country that includes the chief minister on its watch, the body has been de-

fanged, with no one to head it for nearly five months and most IPS posts in its police wing left vacant. It's easy to understand why: four former chief ministers have cases pending before the state lokayukta. Hegde, then lokayukta, uncovered one of the country's biggest mining scams in the latter part of 2011. His report, quantifying the scale of illegal mining at Rs 12,228 crore and listing a strong body of evidence, resulted in Yeddyurappa being jailed for 21 days from October 16, 2011. After Hegde's retirement on August 3, 2011, Justice Shivraj Patil, who succeeded him, had to resign on September 19 upon being accused of holding an illegally acquired housing site in

Bangalore. Ever since, the political establishment has systematically sidelined the office of lokayukta and delayed the naming of a new lokayukta citing lack of a "suitable" judge. The government has weakened the body by not appointing superintendents of police in at least half the state's districts, while the prosecution wing of the lokayukta, burdened with hundreds of cases, has one public prosecutor. There has even been an unseemly public fracas on the appointment of a new one, with former Kerala chief justice S.R. Bannurmath accusing Karnataka governor H.R. Bharadwaj of arbitrarily delaying his appointment as lokayukta, while there is opposition from the public and Congress to the justice getting the post, as he belongs to Yeddyurappa's caste. Kerala and Uttar Pradesh, two other states where proactive lokayuktas have in recent times been a somewhat effective tool against corruption, have a similar story of clamps on the institution. In Kerala, the lokayukta has

jurisdiction over the entire political and administrative executive, including the chief minister, but it cannot initiate suo motu proceedings. The lokayukta does not have independent staff and functions from the state legislative complex. Despite all this, the lokayukta has netted big fish, including then United Democratic Front minister K.K. Ramachandran, who was forced to resign on January 6, 2006, after the lokayukta found him guilty of corruption. In Uttar Pradesh, Lokayukta Justice N.K. Mehrotra has been particularly active in 2011, his recommendations resulting in nine ministers of the Mayawati government getting the boot. He is also probing 19 others ministers. Mehrotra, however, told INDIA TODAY that he does not have prosecution powers and that the investigating team at his disposal is short-staffed. Moreover, the reports of the lokayukta are not binding on the government. Several other states have made sure that the law setting up the

ally an upalokayukta because he is a high court judge. In Madhya Pradesh, the report of the lokayukta absolving Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in a dumper scam was severely criticised for being partisan. Tamil Nadu has not bothered to set up a lokayukta at all. Arch-rivals AIADMK and the ruling DMK both opposed the Centre including the provision of lokayukta in the Lokpal Bill. "The composition of the lokayukta and the framing of rules should be left to the respective state governments," says TKS Elangovan, DMK organising secretary. "Encroaching upon the right of the state governments is against the principle of our democracy," echoes aiadmk MP M. Thambidurai. Most corruption cases in the state are registered by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC), a statecontrolled agency. But even DVAC cannot prosecute without sanction from the state administration. The office of the Andhra Pradesh lokayukta is in a stately old building but its chief occupant, retired High Court Judge S. Ananda Reddy, is a shackled authority. He has no strength to order search and seizure, for only 20 of the 133-strong staff are police personnel. The only genre of complaints that he and upalokayukta MVS Krishnaji Rao can take effective action on is in correcting specific procedural lapses and delays in governance than in bringing serious offenders to book. Bihar has just passed an amended Lokayukta Act, bringing the chief minister and exchief ministers under its purview, but its implementation remains to be seen. "Setting up a lokpal or a lokayukta is not going to help matters. How will the lokpal be better than the high courts or Supreme Court? Until India and its electorate mature as a democ-

racy, nothing else will help," says political commentator Cho Ramaswamy. "The post needs a person who does not care about his own future. Only then will it be effective. If an unsuitable person is appointed, people can always protest,'' says Justice Hegde. Nikhil Dey, who was part of the successful National Campaign for People's Right to Information that ensured the passage of the Right to Information (RTI) Act in Parliament, says the way forward for the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill is to launch a similar campaign. He says success stories of the lokayuktas should be popularised to make the concept of and the need for the ombudsman clear to people. "Like we did for the RTI, we need to mobilise common people to get the law passed. They need to understand how it works along with the Citizen's Charter and Grievance Redressal Bill, the Whistleblowers Protection Bill and the Judicial Accountability Bill. Even if the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill is flawed, it will be better than what we have now," he says. "The concept of the lokpal and lokayuktas has been floating since 1962 when Jawaharlal Nehru set up a committee to study the ombudsman model in Scandanavian countries. Those countries have had an ombudsman for over 200 years. Here, the political class is still not ready to even set it up," says Justice Hegde, who is now with Team Anna. Team Anna says no lokpal without lokayuktas. Stick to lokpal, don't meddle with lokayuktas, says the Trinamool Congress. It seems the political class is happiest without an ombudsman at the Centre and ombudsmen in states looking over them.

lokayukta itself was weak and did not cover either legislators or the chief minister. In Maharashtra, which was the first state to establish the institution of lokayukta in 1972, the office has the power of investigation but not inquiry. There is no separate investigation agency under its wing. Maharashtra has not formed the state vigilance commission required to assist the lokayukta in investigation. The lokayukta did not even investigate the Adarsh Society scam; the state government set up a separate inquiry commission for it. In Rajasthan, which instituted a lokayukta in 1973, only public servants in service can be acted against. The lokayukta has no investigating agency of its own or attached to it and doesn't have punitive powers. "Many flaws have emerged in the Lokayukta Act here and elsewhere but no steps have been taken to rectify those," says Rajasthan Lokayukta Justice G.L. Gupta. In Assam the current Lokayukta, D. Biswas, is actu-
