CARE TODAY

A N I N D I A T O D A Y G R O U P I N I T I AT I V E

are Today Fund appeals to peace-loving individuals and corporate houses to reach out to the people affected by the outbreak of violence in Assam, and contribute actively to the Assam Relief Fund. Organised violence by any community and disrespect towards the law is unacceptable in a civilised society. In Assam, miscreants from two communities brutally killed innocent people. According to the media and NGOs, over 250 camps have been providing temporary shelter to more than 400,000 displaced people living in constant fear. Schools have been turned into relief camps, while children have lost their textbooks. Many of these camps are cramped and the conditions therein could potentially become a health hazard and result in more deaths. To provide humanitarian support to affected communities, Care Today Fund has set up the Assam Relief Fund.
