ia Pauro, 35, launched her boutique Rock-a-bella in 2010 with much fanfare. Fashion is a natural instinct that she says is a creative channel. Designing allows her freedom of expression. "I have always loved fashion and at a young age I discovered that I wanted to pursue a career in it," she says. She graduated from the London College of Fashion and worked with labels like Topshop, Diesel, Nicole Farhi, American Eagle amongst others. Her latest collection which she

showcased at the Wills Lifestyle Fashion Week 2013 in Delhi is resort wear which is all about prints inspired from 3D geometrics and embroideries influenced from Sind. She enjoys talking about her love for fashion and says it's an intense energy of creation that should be interpreted the way one feels comfortable. "While designing a collection, I use prints, beads and embroideries. It takes me six months to come up with a new collection as I like to research a lot and bring out my best," she  by Marcia Rodrigues explains.

lamour and fashion are the two words that best describe Pernia Quereshi and her pop-up-store. She graduated as a lawyer from the George Washington University in the US but couldn't ignore her passion for fashion, and went ahead to make a career in it. The 28 year old stylist is the person behind Sonam Kapoor's much talked about chic look in the film Aisha. A trained Kuchipudi dancer who takes inspiration from the famous Raja Radha Reddy, she started her career as a stylist and costume designer in New York. "My pop-up shop is basically India's first high fashion premier multi brand online store which features the country's biggest names in the fashion fraternity. We stock creations by names like Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Varun Bahl, Ritu Kumar, Gaurav Gupta, Masaba, Shivan & Narresh, Atsu Sekhose, jewellery designers like Zariin, Outhouse and Isharya," she says. At present the online store stocks over 40 designers and offers beautiful, hand-picked items for its customers. She says, "Working for Aisha was the best thing that happened to me--it changed my career."

Chic and bling

ll of 24, Mira Gulati's entry into the Indian jewellery scene where the family jeweller still scores over a jewellery designer was a challenge. But whether it was due to her avant-garde designs or the changing global Indian mindset, Gulati's brand Mirari worked well and is now a popular luxury jewellery brand. "Perhaps the biggest challenge for me was my age. People preferred to buy from their own family jewellers and I had to establish myself then," says Gulati. Armed with a course from the Gemological Institute of America (2004-

2005), she set up the first Mirari store in 2007 at Shangri-La hotel. While the first store is now shut, Mirari retails from her outlets in Emporio and a recently opened one in Greater Kailash. "The aim behind Mirari was to set up a truly Indian luxury jewellery brand," says Mira. Mirari's USP is the elegance and contemporary designs of its jewellery, whether neckpieces, earrings or bracelets with diamonds, beads, emerald, sapphire and other precious stones. Apart from the luxury jewellery, Mirari has also launched its prêt collection and a collec by Rewati Rau tion for children.

STYLE TIP Briolette is great for special occasions. It works really well in earrings as well as pendants

Payal Jain

he turning point in her fashion career came way back in 1994, when she held her first show in aid of Tamanna Special School for mentally and physically challenged children. That decided the future course for fashion designer Payal Jain, 41, who has ever since married social causes along with fashion. So, be it working with artisans of UP, Rajasthan, Bihar and Bengal or holding fund raisers for cancer patients or specially-abled children, she revolves her work around it . "I always wanted to be an architect, but as I completed my commerce from Jesus and Mary College, Delhi, I decided I couldn't stand and plan concrete structures." Pursuing her love for sketching, she went for a Fashion Design course in San Francisco in 1991. By 1994, she was back, and had launched her eponymous label in the same year. One of the few designers at the time to design western wear, Jain says designing niche clothing was a struggle in itself. "During those days, fashion designers were glorified tailors. Moreover, every Indian woman wore Indian clothes, so it was not easy for me. The struggle continued for almost a decade till the fashion weeks began in 2000." Today, Payal is well-known in the industry for designing western clothes with  by Rewati Rau "an Indian soul."

Understated chic Vineet Bahl

is first encounter with designing was during his school days, when Vineet Bahl, 35, had to design a corset for a school play. And it all started from there. "I started researching on Christian Lacroix and YSL's work, scouring newspapers, magazines and TV for their designs. I got out of school by which time I already had a compilation of my sketches," he says. "I took a chance and with fingers crossed, I sent my sketch book to Christian Lacroix. I wasn't entirely disappointed--my sketch

hile most of our designers are busy reviving the past and Indian fashion is still dominated by traditional wear, designer Atsu Sekhose, 32, believes in doing things differently. His designs are known for being modern and wearable as well as for their tailored fits, with extraordinary colour sensibility. He started his label `Atsu' in 2006. He was invited by The National Chamber to showcase his Spring Summer 2010 collection at Milan Fashion Week. After graduating from NIFT in 2001, Sekhose interned with fashion designer Tarun Tahiliani and Spanish brand Zara for a couple of years. He struggled to create a niche market for his unapologetically western clothes since most boutiques wanted Indian wear. "As a one-man-team without any financial backing or corporate sponsor, there were a lot of challenges," he says. "The Naga sensibility will always be a part of my designs because it's where I belong," says the designer, adding, "But thanks to my travels across cultures and international boundaries, I have discovered fashion in a whole new light." After his demi-couture fashion line and Spring Summer 2012 menswear collection, he's now focusing on a blend of traditional fabric and contemporary design. At the recently concluded Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week, he showcased parkas in Eri silk, Assamese muga silk shirts, Angami pencil skirts and Mizo woven  byShilpa Mehta silk pants.

book was returned with a handwritten note from Lacroix himself urging me to join a fashion school to hone my skills," says the designer. Bahl has now been designing since 10 years and his label is a regular at Coterie, Tranoi and Whosnext. He believes in the idea of `profundity in simplicity.' "I design for women of all age groups across body types. I don't celebrate size zero and I look beyond designing for women who are `in the know'," says the designer. Bahl works with free flowing silhouettes that allow the body to be easy and comfortable. "I only make clothes that are as much wearable off the ramp as on it,"  by Ekta Alreja says the designer.

STYLE TIP For the coming season I think the Moroccan lace work shirt dress is a great piece to have from my SS13 collection. It straddles both Indian as well as western sensibility
