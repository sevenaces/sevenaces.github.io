U

nion Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh managed to broker peace with the Jan Satyagrahis who marched to Delhi from Madhya

Pradesh on October 11. Sweeping back his mane of hair, he addressed the satyagrahis in Agra, saying, "Andolan ka shor democracy ka sangeet hai (The noise of agitation is music in a democracy)." So far so good. Then, as usual, he got carried away and exclaimed, "andolan is like liquid oxygen. Oxygen will keep the sangathan (organisation) alive and liquid won't let the andolan die". If he outspeaks his usefulness as a Cabinet minister, there is always Bollywood.

JAGAN'S ACCUSER IN THE DOCK

M

averick Congress MLA P. Shankar Rao, who filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Andhra Pradesh High Court that led to the CBI probe into the assets of Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has gone into hiding. On October 12, the Andhra Pradesh High Court vacated a stay on a warrant for his arrest in a land encroachment case. S. Chandrasekhar, a member of the Green Fields Plot Owners' Association, had submitted a petition in the high court alleging that Rao, a fivetime MLA and two-term minister, forged documents to grab 72 acres of land in Kanajiguda village in the northern suburbs of Hyderabad. Rao's claim is that the land belonged to his father. From crusader to accused, in the blink of an eye?

RAHUL'S CORE CONSTITUENCY
ongress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi attended a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on finance last week of which he is a member. The committee was deciding the agenda for 2013. For a change, Rahul was first to speak. He said that there was a need to look at long-term strategic planning as well as a need to focus on core issues. The young Congress leader didn't elaborate what these core issues were but that didn't stop every Congressman who spoke after him from reiterating that the committee's focus should be on "core issues" .

THE CONGRESS REKHA
hat's with the Congress and its sudden obsession with Rekha? While wishing Amitabh Bachchan, Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh tweeted that "on 10th October Rekha's birthday. On 11th October Amitabh's. Coincidence?"Later when Congress spokesperson Renuka Chowdhury was asked to comment on Bachchan's birthday, she retorted, "Rekha's birthday was on October 10 but no one asked me for a comment on that. Isn't that gender bias!"

TOUGH LUCK FOR GOGOI
ssam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi was invited by the Youth Congress to address its national executive in Srinagar. Also invited to speak at the event were Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni, Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. But Gogoi wasn't as lucky as the rest. He had to leave a day before Rahul Gandhi arrived in the state, and missed his Rahul moment.

WIDE BERTH

ongress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury is among the West Bengal leaders who have been clamouring for Cabinet berths ever since Mamata Banerjee made her famous exit. But given that he has a criminal track record, both Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh are not keen to include him in the Cabinet. Making him state Congress chief will be a consolation prize. And then they wonder why the Congress has been wiped out in West Bengal.

wami Vivekananda has never been so popular in Gujarat. On October 15, it was RSS leader Sanjay Joshi's turn to celebrate Swami Vivekanand's 150th birth celebrations in Surat. The function was organised by sidelined BJP leaders such as Ishwar Patel, Dipak Dudhwala and Indravan Sukhani. Joshi, who has no love lost for Narendra Modi and vice versa, said, "Those who have organised this function and called me to grace it should be prepared to face the consequences. If they are looking for a ticket, they should not expect it." Or indeed, anything else.

hree BJP MPs from Bihar have been visiting UPA Cabinet ministers and complaining about the misuse of funds meant for Centrally-aided schemes in the state. Unfortunately for the trio, one Cabinet minister lost no time in reporting them to Nitish Kumar. The Bihar Chief Minister is not amused. Last heard, he was saying that none of the three would get re-elected from his state.
