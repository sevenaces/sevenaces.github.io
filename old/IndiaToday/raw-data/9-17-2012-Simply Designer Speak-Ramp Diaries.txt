Fashion is in the air in the capital, with PCJ Delhi Couture Week 2012 having concluded recently in the city. SIMPLY DELHI caught up with the city's fashion design stalwarts, JJ Valaya, Manish Arora and Shantanu and Nikhil for a tête-à-tête where they shared their views on the Couture Week, their personal fashion styles and their inspirations. Q. What led you take up fashion as a career? Did you always know that's what you wanted or was it something that happened out of the blue? A. I was actually training to be a chartered accountant. I didn't know what I wanted to be or what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to do something creative and fashion just happened. Q. What would you consider the one event that was your `big break' into the world of fashion? A. I was living in Chandigarh in the late 80's when somebody told me

about this new institute that had opened up in Delhi. At a time when fashion institutes were synonymous with tailoring colleges, the National Institute of Fashion and Technology (NIFT) came into the scene and completely turned things around. For me, enrolling into NIFT in 1988 is what I consider `divine intervention.' Q. What has been your idea behind this season's designs? A. For me couture is always about timelessness and I don't think that trends always work. I want my designs to be passed on through generations. For example, recently I had a client for whom I had designed bridal wear more than two decades ago. She came to me a few days ago asking me to alter the same dress to fit her daughter. This to me was an amazing feeling. Q. Has the line been inspired by something or somebody?

Our couture displays have been titled, The Azrak collection, The Realm of the Sultan. The collection finds its inspiration from the Ottoman Empire. Azrak in Turkish means `rare and uncommon.' Its a fitting title for this collection as it stands inspired by some exceptional arts from the Ottoman Empire. Q. Any particular aspect of the designs you would like to highlight? A. We do the finest embroideries in the country and this is one of our greatest selling points. I also nurture a great interest in Indian arts and crafts and I want to revive these craft traditions and make it relevant to the modern world. Q What's your personal fashion style? A. It's simplistic with a lot of attention to detail. I like neutral colour dresses with an occasional pop of bright coloured accessories.

Q& A

Q. What led you take up fashion as a career? Did you always know that's what you wanted or was it something that happened out of the blue? A. Fashion was accidental. I'd never thought I'd end up as a fashion designer. I use fashion as a platform for my art. Moving away from my commerce degree and getting enrolled at NIFT, Delhi in the 90's was the turning point. From there on in, it has always been about creativity, art and design. Q. What would you consider the one event that was your `big break' into the world of fashion? A. The year I spent working with the Spanish fashion legend, Paco Rabanne was a game changer for me.

Q. What's your personal fashion style? A. My designs are an extension of myself. I put my heart and soul into every collection. But my personal style is completely different. I like to dress neat and crisp and sport black and other dark shades as much as possible. Q. What does the Delhi Couture Week mean to you? A. It is a sort of homecoming for me. This is my first runway show in India after a three year break and it feels good to showcase my Paris collections here. My collections are prêt-àporter but it has consumed as much energy and time as designing couture would do. Q. Has the line been inspired by something or somebody? A. My inspirations are from all over

the place. Anything from India POP and Warriors that were the themes behind my work in 08-09 to Graffiti Art and `The joy of living in the 60's,' which was what motivated my latest Photographs by CHANDERDEEP KUMAR/www.indiatodayimages.com designs. Hybrid animals, magic, the circus--all these have been sources of inspirations for my creations over the last few years. The designs I displayed here this time around are a retrospective of my collections which I have showcase in various Paris Fashion Weeks. Q. If you have to have a `fashion ideology' what would it be? A. Always remember, that you are only as good as your last collection. You have to constantly surpass your own capabilities in order to create designs that are of value in today's competitive market.

Q& A

Shantanu and Nikhil Mehra

"The designers'fraternity wasliterally was literally on the street for 6-8 months. " months"
Q. In these 12 years that you've been in the fashion world, which moment do you consider as your `big break?' A. Well we really feel it's yet to come. But the one time our work really got recognised was when actor Shilpa Shetty wore one of our gowns at the IIFA awards in 2006. That set off a trend and today women have started wearing gowns for their cocktail functions instead of lehengas. Q. Tell us a bit about the struggles you had to go through to establish yourself? A. Though we haven't struggled too much, the one time we really had a tough time was when our shop, along with other designer stores got demolished at MG Road. The designers' fraternity was literally on the street for 6-8 months and had no direction. Q. What does the Delhi Couture Week mean to you? A. It's a platform to be really creative. It's the place where you can do anything you want and your opinion really matters. It's one of those opportunities for us to let people know what we want to say. Q. Tell us something about the collection you showcased at the 3rd Delhi Couture Week concluded recently. This collection of ours titled `She is the One,' is an ode to the woman of today. With this collection, we want to portray a strong woman who says `there's a hurricane in me'. This woman has gone through a crazy time but is a survivor. So the silhouettes are hard, the clothes are dark, vintage and not flowery. This is a stark contrast to last time's Perfume collection which was soft and delicate. Q. What has been your inspiration? A. We get inspired by spaces and places around us. Right now, there's an undertone of darkness all around us. There's been a barrage of bad news since the past one year. That affects our work. Especially when we talk about the Indian woman, there's so much lag--on one hand, we call her bharat mata and on the other, we rape her. Q. Black is not usually a colour associated with Indian weddings. How come you've used so much of it in Couture Week, which is all about wedding couture? A. Indian weddings have changed over the years and have become pretty liberal. There's even a concept of theme weddings. So, even if someone doesn't want to wear black on the wedding day, it can be worn for a cocktail or a bachelorette party. Q. Talking about the current season, what do you think are the colours and fabrics of this season? A. It's a pop colour palette this season. You'll find a bright orange amongst navy blues, gold with greens. And the fabrics are mostly antique like linens and quilts.
