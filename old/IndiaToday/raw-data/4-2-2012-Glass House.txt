UNSAFE DISTANCE
ujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was chief guest at a March 18 function in Pune organised by veteran Gandhian Mohan Dharia. But he found an unpleasant neighbour in the audience, Pune MP Suresh Kalmadi. When Kalmadi extended his hand in greeting, the Chief Minister played it safe, with a namaste. Modi made sure not to make eye contact with Kalmadi again. Much to the disappointment of waiting photographers.

SUDDEN CELEBRITY

SHEKHAR

eeraj Shekhar, the Samajwadi Party (SP) MP from Ballia, lived a low-profile life until his party swept the Uttar Pradesh polls. At a party function in the Capital recently, he was accosted by a Page 3 personality who first asked him, "Are you an MP?" He said yes, from Ballia. "But isn't that Chandra Shekharji's constituency? How did you get it?" he was asked. Neeraj replied that he was Chandra Shekhar's son. "My God, you are from SP," exclaimed the socialite. With electoral success comes celebrity status.

SACHIN'S SCORE

N

ow that Sachin Tendulkar has scored his much-awaited century, Maharashtra politicians want to score a political point. MPCC President Manikrao Thakre has demanded an international museum be dedicated to the master blaster. Shiv Sena is planning to house Tendulkar memorabilia in a cricket gallery at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's Andheri Sports Complex. The batting maestro, however, is unlikely to oblige either party. In 2010, he did not respond to the state government's request that he become brand ambassador for Maharashtra. In 2011, he escaped being felicitated by then mayor Shraddha Jadhav, saying he was far too busy playing cricket.

SELF HELP

A

ndhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy has decided to give himself a raise of some 400 per cent. He gets Rs 41,500 a month now and after the Andhra Pradesh Payment of Salaries and Pension and Removal of Disqualification (Amendment) Bill, 2012, he will be getting Rs 2,35,000 a month. It includes a constituency allowance of Rs 83,000 a month. This does not take into account what is spent on his official home. The Act will also raise salaries of Reddy's ministers, the leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council, as well as the ruling party's chief whip. Salaries were last increased in 2000. All this will cost the exchequer an extra Rs 25 crore a year. Only.

ROYAL FIT

P

unjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh's disgruntled younger brother Malvinder Singh joined the Shiromani Akali Dal after being denied a Congress ticket. But he hasn't lost his loyalty to royalty. On March 17, during an Akali Dal victory celebration in Samana constituency, he objected vehemently when a speaker said the verdict was the final decimation of "the arrogant Patiala Royals". Grabbing the microphone, Malvinder exploded: "The rajas of Patiala are alive and kicking, and I am proof, right here!"

QUICK GETAWAY
riyanka Gandhi Vadra gave her children the weekend getaway she promised them after the hectic but disappointing poll campaign in Uttar Pradesh. She took son Raihan and daughter Miraya to Wildflower Hall in Shimla. While the children refined their riding skills amid the pine forests surrounding Lord Kitchener's erstwhile summer home, Priyanka used the time to finalise building plans for her own summer cottage, which she pulled down in 2011. Rahul Gandhi also went for a break, abroad.

SWEET HUMOUR
hen NCP leader Sharad Pawar had a dizzy spell in Parliament on March 13, he was immediately rushed to hospital. The check-up revealed low blood sugar, at which the Maharashtra leader immediately quipped,"Imagine it happening to me! I am from a state that is known for its sugar production, and I even own sugar mills." At least the veteran minister has not lost his sense of humour.

PRIYANKA WITH HER CHILDREN

SUPREME VIEW

T

he Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) has found an unlikely ally in Pakistan Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. When Inter-Services Intelligence and Pakistan's Military Intelligence said in the country's Supreme Court that India's RAW and Israel's Mossad were behind recent kidnappings in Pakistan, Chaudhry asked their counsel why they had not acted against them then. Ironically, the counsel for Omar Mehmood Khan, 24, who was abducted in Islamabad on March 10, alleged that he had been picked up by Pakistan's intelligence agencies. A furious Chaudhry said, "We will not allow anyone to act above the law."
