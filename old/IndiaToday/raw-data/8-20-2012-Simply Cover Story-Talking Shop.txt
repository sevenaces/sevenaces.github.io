TWEETMINTT
Bored of putting up the same old streamers and balloons for her daughter's birthday parties, art and craft enthusiast Parul Ohri decided to create party decorations using things at home. "It was very difficult to find fancy decorations, and cartoon characters back then. They weren't as easily available as they are now," says Ohri. One of her initial experiments involved making magnets as return gifts--she set plaster of paris in idli moulds, stuck magnets on one side and painted cartoon characters on the other. Her creativity was often admired by guests at her parties, and she soon began getting orders to create birthday invites and return gifts. Seven years later, she's graduated from magnets to themes, decorations and personalised return gifts for children across Delhi and NCR. Her brand Tweetmintt aims to create "minty fresh items for little tweeties". If you wish to add some jazz to your party then we suggest

giving Parul a call-- cards, calendars, books, diaries, towels, stationary, toys, boxes, packets, return gifts, frames, you name it and she'll create it. "Now I have a set of people working with me, so once I've met the client and decided on a design, I know how to execute it," she says.

As the years went by, the store kept increasing and subtracting their departments, but the lifestyle section still remains the most frequented one. Here, you will find a number of décor and utility items from both India and abroad--from a coaster designed by a student of

NIFT to paintings by designer Rohit Kant. The store also stocks items by quirky brands like Happily Unmarried, Play Clan, Chumbak and more. In its present avatar, Rio Grande has a blend of ethnic and contemporary products, so you can shop for gorgeous Buddha statues, Tanjore paintings, cushion covers, quirky posters of Superman v/s Mohammad Ali among others. The stationary section comprises a host of folders, pens, laptop cases, fancy handmade paper, and many products like pen stands made of recycled material.
