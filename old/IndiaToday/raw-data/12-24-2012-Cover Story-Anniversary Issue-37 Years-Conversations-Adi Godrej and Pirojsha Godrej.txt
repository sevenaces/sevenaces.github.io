In 1897, Mumbai-based brothers Ardeshir and Pirojsha Godrej founded what was to become one of India's best known and most successful business conglomerates. Once synonymous with manufacturing India's safest locks, the Godrej brand has now diversified into areas as varied as consumer goods, chemicals, real estate and re-

tail. The man responsible for reinventing the group post-liberalisation is the 70-year-old patriarch Adi Godrej. Sometime in the future, the reins of the Godrej empire will pass from Adi to his children--Tanya Dubash, Nisa Godrej and the youngest, Pirojsha Godrej. Pirojsha, 31, is already CEO of a group company, Godrej Properties.

In the office of Godrej Properties in the historic Fort Area of Mumbai, the father-son team sit down in a spartan conference room to talk to DEPUTY EDITOR DHIRAJ NAYYAR about the future of family businesses, the importance of competition, the nature of business and how they see the future of India. Adi and Pirojsha are different

A generation apart, they have their obvious differences. What they share in common is a passion for business and commitment to India. Excerpts. India Today (IT) Both of you are inheritors of a family business. Do you think family business will survive in India in the long run or will it become increasingly professionalised? Adi Godej (AG) Most businesses in the world are family businesses. So yes, they will survive. We think family businesses can be very professional. There

are some businesses which are not run by a family but are broadly owned and run by people with some shareholding--such as Larsen & Toubro, or ITC in India. Pirojsha Godrej (PG) As the economy develops, the relative influence of family business as a proportion of all businesses diminishes and that is likely to happen in India as well. But certainly as a part of any economy, family businesses do play a critical role, and there is a case to be made that in India that could be even more prevalent than some of the advanced economies because of certain sociocultural feelings about business and keeping them and passing them on within family control.

IT Your family name is also your brand. How important is that? AG Around 500 million Indians use our products every day, so clearly the brand is very important. We are mainly a consumer-facing business. It helps us when we introduce new products, makes us emphasise trust. PG Branding is critical whether it's a family name or Google or Apple. You live and work by the brand's value. IT When you joined the business, is there any particular advice you got from elders that held you in good stead for the future? AG When I joined the business, my grandfather was running it. He was chairman of the group; my father and

"In FMCGs, we are very competitive within and outside India whereas Chinese companies are not. Most of the successful FMCG companies in China are MNCs, not Chinese companies." Adi Godrej
"Even though there is considerable competition from China, Indian companies can learn from them and try to achieve their scale and efficiency." Pirojsha Godrej

"When the economy gets large, companies tend to become international. So would Indian businesses.The Tatas already have a large chunk of their income coming from abroad. "Adi Godrej

two uncles were in it. They told me the business depended on the people of our country and that we must take care of them. Early on I had suggested to my father that we should get into the tobacco business. He turned it down straightaway saying it was harmful to people. PG Certainly, a long list. One of the things my father told me is that you should be as excited about a Monday morning as a Friday evening. You should be excited about your work, passionate about what you are doing. IT Is the future of Indian business in large diversified conglomerates or niche companies? AG Indian businesses are diversified because in the early days they were not exposed to competition owing to a closed economy. Second, avenues for growth were restricted because of laws such as Industrial Development Act and Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act. So people did diversify to grow. I feel people will now focus on existing segments. We are looking at expanding our existing businesses. In fact, we have shed a few businesses in the last five years. PG I would like to focus on real estate. The general trend would be that of companies having a lower number of businesses and focusing on them. IT Where will the greatest competition to Indian businesses come from-- Indian businesses or MNCs from the West or Chinese companies? AG All three. More competition is good for the economy. I am for opening up the Indian economy to competition. I wouldn't say there will be more com-

petition but there will certainly be more competitors. PG Each industry and sector is different. For instance in real estate, for the foreseeable future, most of the competition will come from other Indian companies. That is not the same for an FMCG company or agri company. IT There seems to be a general paranoia about China. Should Indian businesses fear China? AG No, they shouldn't. It depends on the product category. For example, all our microwave ovens are sourced from China under the Godrej brand, all our baby diapers, some air-conditioners are sourced from China. So China is competitive in some product categories and India in others. PG Some of the fundamentals will change 10 years from now. A lot of the fears about China because of its lowcost labour and low-cost manufacturing of goods will decrease over a period of time as wealth accumulates there. India can learn from them and try to achieve their scale and efficiency. There can be synergies between the two and there is no reason why it has to be a purely competitive relationship. Growth in China is good for the world and for India. IT How do you see the relationship between government and business evolving in the future? AG I am a great believer in free enterprise. I don't call it capitalism. There are two conditions in free enterprise that makes it work. One is competition and the other is preventing monopoly. Once you do that, the entrepreneurship of people makes it the best eco-

nomic system. The less government interferes the better. I do believe in independent regulators that are neither answerable to the government nor to private enterprise, and not government regulators. The government should not have too many decisionmaking powers. It's only when the government starts controlling things that corruption increases. If we have a good economic system, India can easily achieve 10 per cent growth rate. PG The way governance is happening in India is far from ideal, but we are moving in the right direction. We should be encouraged by fundamental things that have happened in the last 20 years--the creation of a middle class and economic reforms. We are a large country and the population does not fully understand the benefits of a free market economy but certainly that is the right way to go. IT Do you agree that Mumbai's potential is held back by the awful state of its infrastructure? AG I think infrastructure could be much better all over India and particularly in Mumbai. I have grown up in Mumbai and see a lot of improvement from the earlier days. Given a choice, I would always choose Mumbai for doing business. PG We have the ingredients. We have the human capital. A lot of wealth is being created. There is nothing stopping us from becoming a world-class city except for the mismanagement. I think we are the only country in G20 that does not have empowered managers or heads of cities. We require an empowered head of Mumbai answerable to the citizens. I don't think things will look very different in next two-three years but I am quite optimistic that things will change for the better in 20 years. IT What is the one thing that makes you optimistic about India's economic future and what is the one thing that worries you? AG I am optimistic about its demography and democracy. Both will ensure a strong future for India. What worries me is whether we can leverage our demography. Training, skilling and education need to be done carefully. If we get that right, our future is very bright. PG The fact that we have so many young people is a big bonus. There is a palpable excitement in India today. Unlocking and capturing that through education and creating a vibrant economy is what I am most optimistic about. The quality of governance is what makes me pessimistic. I don't think there are enough politicians from my generation at senior levels. The gap between the average age of the political leadership in India and average age of the population is probably the widest in the world. As a system, we are still not at the point where there is a general consensus on the kind of policies that are needed for growth. I feel we are still at a stage where we are taking two steps forward and one step back.
