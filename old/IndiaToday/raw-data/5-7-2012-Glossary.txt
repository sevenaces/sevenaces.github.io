DOCU DRAMA
Looks like Mallika Sherawat's international debut Hisss, in which she played a man-eating snake goddess, was a disaster on screen and off it too. During the making of the film, Sherawat and the producers-- her brother Vikram Singh and good friend Govind Menon--sidelined the director Jennifer Lynch, forcing her to quit the film.Two years later, a miffed Lynch has made a behindthe-scenes documentary titled Despite the Gods. It features footage of Lynch's desperation to keep a grip on her film during the shoots and engaging in verbal duels with Sherawat's brother.
