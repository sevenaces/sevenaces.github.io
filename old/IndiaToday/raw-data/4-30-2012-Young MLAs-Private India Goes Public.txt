Minister of State for Protocol and Chief Minister's Office, Samajwadi Party This is the first time Samajwadi Party has swept urban Lucknow north. One of Mishra's first assignments was to represent his state at the National Capital Region Planning Board, the first time Uttar Pradesh was being represented by a minister. "Earlier, we would send a secretary-level officer who couldn't pitch for funds. That is why UP got only Rs 660 crore and Haryana Rs 5,800 crore," he says. "We're going to fight very hard for the money the Centre is not giving us. If you

present a compelling case, no one can refuse," he says. It looks like the Chief Minister has picked the right calling card in this suave professorturned-smart politician.

t's the age of Akhilesh Yadav, Sukhbir Singh Badal and Manohar Parrikar. The 38-year-old Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh is an environmental engineer, the 49-year-old Deputy Chief Minister of Punjab is an MBA while Goa's 56-year-old Chief Minister is a metallurgical engineer. Many in the Class of 2012 are like them. Their poster boy is Abhishek Mishra from Lucknow, a former IIM professor. Each brings to his constituency a different work style to tackle basic problems of electricity, water and roads. One has a dedicated team which helps single women and senior citizens deal with bureaucracy while another wants to make water harvesting mandatory. A third wants to make the beaches of Goa as clean as those in Thailand's Phuket and Pattaya. As Mishra says, "People now feel that politics is also a profession open to the educated elite." Importantly, they also lead a life other than politics and if they own an Armani or a Porsche, are not afraid to flaunt it. Unlike a run-of-the-mill first-time BSP MLA, who is an avid golfer, but is scared to be photographed playing it.

MANPREET SINGH AYALI 37
DAKHA PUNJAB

Shiromani Akali Dal MLA Politics was his dream but business was in his blood. Sensing the real estate boom years before it began in the mid-2000s, he used his family's substantial agricultural landholdings to build a multi-crore realty empire. His concern is new-ageissues like environment. He has already helped 108 villages clean and reinvigorate old ponds. "Besides improving sanitation, this becomes a means of treating water naturally and helps with water harvesting," he says. Another priority is to improve the roads between villages. His office in Mullanpur town, 10 km off

Ludhiana, has a computer centre where operators constantly update data for every village and town. He entered politics via the Youth Akali Dal and became chairman of Ludhiana Zila Parishad five years ago.

Twenty-four years ago, he was washing dishes in a hotel to feed his family. Lobo couldn't study beyond Class XII as he had no money. He drew inspiration from a wall hanging at a neighbour's house that said `Nothing is impossible, says my boss.' At 17, he invested in a small pottery factory. Today, he owns two resorts, two restaurants, an interior decoration firm and a construction firm. Formerly a zila panchayat member, Lobo may have become an MLA only in March, but he is a busy man already, apologising to his wife for not answering her frantic phone calls. "You know how many

people come to see me," he says, trying to pacify her. His priority is to build a market complex and parking space in Calangute, one of Goa's most popular beaches.

For the last 10 years, a helpless Shimray watched the hardship that villagers in his area faced. "There are no health centres, no power or quality schools. The roads are pathetic. The villagers kept asking for my help, so I decided to be part of the political set-up." He quit his job as a senior scientific officer in the environment and ecology department, Manipur, to fight the 2012 election. He wants to provide loans to unemployed youth so they can start small businesses based on horticulture and dairy farming.

Samajwadi Party MLA

His hair was grey before he filed his nomination so he can't blame his new profession for that. Owner of Drosia budget hotels, one each in Mumbai and Dubai, Rehman says his new line of work is not too different from the old. "It's the quality of service that matters," he says. While campaigning, he saw a girl crushed to death under a truck in a crowded street. "I decided if I win, I will build a flyover here," he says. A fortnight after his win, he went to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav complete with the design and estimate for the new flyover. "We need planned

infrastructure, no use building a road and then digging it up again for the sewer," he says.

He wants to generate employment in Manipur through industrialisation. "I want to bring one agrobased industry per village. It could be corn, tapioca, passion fruit, pineapple. We have the raw materials." To promote this idea, Singh has started canvassing other MLAs for support. He had contested the 2007 Assembly polls, but lost to the sitting Cabinet minister by two votes.
