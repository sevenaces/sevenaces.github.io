FEROZE GUJRAL, Former Model and Socialite

I would describe my style as curious and whimsical. I can team lehengas with T-shirts and wear anklets as wrist couture. From a subtle look to a brash, risqué one, I have enjoyed all moods of fashion. You need to know your body and only then you can make an outfit work your way.

CHARU SACHDEV,
CEO, The Sachdev Group

Personal style is all about being strong, yet feminine. I love long hair and feminine dresses. But at the same time I love pairing it with a biker jacket. I like creating looks that are my own. Dresses, and a black and white blazer are my wardrobe essentials.

VESNA JACOB, Fitness Trainer

Fashion is an extension of who you are, and it should enhance your personality. Though not a brand freak, I love the fit and style of Calvin Klein, Pucci and Versace dresses.

JAVED HABIB, Celebrity Hair Stylist

For me, black and grey have been my style companions for more than two decades now. And it's amazing to see how much of variation is possible in these two shades. For me, fashion is Indian design, and I think our designers are the most creative of the lot.

SIMPLY DELHI  OCTOBER 2012

I take style inspiration from the cities I have lived in: Miami, New York, Istanbul, Los Angeles and Delhi. But I have learnt over the time that classic sustains, and the rest is transient. At work, I usually wear well-fitted suits with a touch of makeup. I believe my romance with clean lines and well-articulated clothes will stay forever.
