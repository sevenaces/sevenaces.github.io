The YEARof RESENTMENT

A crime so brutal that it questioned a nation's humanity; corruption allegations that reached the highest of the high coupled with governance disasters had an anguished India spilling onto the streets trying to wake up a sleeping Establishment. It's been a year of shifting political sands as allies played musical chairs with the Government, but an Opposition paralysed with a leadership crisis couldn't take advantage. 2012 ended with the political class staring at banners, tweets and status updates that sent a grim message on the eve of the General Elections.
