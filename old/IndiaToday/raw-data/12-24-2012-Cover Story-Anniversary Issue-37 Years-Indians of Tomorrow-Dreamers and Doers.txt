Dreamers AND DOERS
or our bumbling cricket team, we desperately need young voices and young faces. As old institutions collapse or begin to stagnate and familiar voices become faint echoes, a new India is turning towards its one source of limitless capital--the youth. Thirty-seven young Indians, all under the age of 35, have broken boundaries, questioned received wisdom and changed established ways of thinking in their respective fields. They include iPadwielding politicians and new-age civil servants who speak for the marginalised; actors and sportspersons who promise to light up a billion-plus faces in the years to come; and artists and writers whose style and substance will lay the imprint for the future. While some are familiar faces, there are other quiet performers whose patriotism is lived through the work they do. For every Ranbir Kapoor, there is a Krishnakumar Balasubramanian who wants to bring "technology" to the stage by enacting live action sequences. For every Virat Kohli, there is a Devendro Singh who is our big hope for an Olympic medal after Mary Kom. Or Zainab Kakal, 26, who designs tour packages that promote the participation and uplift of local communities. Or Sanjay Vijayakumar, 28, who showed his entrepreneurial skills by launching a start-up when he was an engineering student and turning it into a Rs 25-crore company in seven years. Or Shama Khan, 29, the award-winning pradhan who has been working tirelessly for women's education and empowerment bang in the middle of the Thar desert, along the India-Pakistan border. Media and the Internet have proved to be crucial vehicles for the young entrepreneurs. Some have used it to create companies, others to focus on development. Then there is Kanan Dhru, 29, who is trying to get young people interested in governance through her think tank. And Naman Pugalia, 25, who sets up interactive sessions with politicians. For the Indians of Tomorrow, the route to success has been difficult and different. But common to all is a belief that change is not a function of one, it needs the multitude. by Jayant Sriram

Because the founder of the Research Foundation for Governance in India (RFGI), Ahmedabad, did the unthinkable: Got youngsters interested in politics. A collaborative RFGI project called `Jaago Re!' resulted in 10,000 new young voters in Gujarat participating in the 2009 General Elections. Because she is bullish about bringing governance closer to the citizen. Her first project studied why litigation in Gujarat was a family fiefdom. Students with good academic records but no lineage of law scarcely stood a chance for a legal career. "In six Gujarat cities, the rate of young lawyers dropping out was 67 per cent. Fortyseven per cent young lawyers were not paid at all for the first three years of work," she says. Another project probed the role of the Lokayukta in Kerala and how to strengthen grievance redress systems. Because she wants to see real democracy in India's political parties.

DEEPAK RAVINDRAN
25, CEO & Co-founder, Innoz, Gurgaon/Thrissur

FINDING FORMULA
BY SONALI ACHARJEE

Because in the Internet age, he has proved that the quest for information doesn't have to be synonymous with a Google search. With very little personal capital, Ravindran, along with five friends, dropped out of college and set up a company that is now listed in the Limca Book of Records as the largest offline search provider in the world. Because he recognised that in rural India, where Internet is rare but nearly everybody owns a mobile phone, an SMS query service would have millions of takers. The move paid off and Innoz now gets over five million search queries per day on topics ranging from the square root of pi to Kareena Kapoor's dress size. Because within a year, he has acquired a database of 400 million customers across India and has expanded to Dubai, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. He plans to add six more countries to the list in the next few months.
Eureka moment The idea to set up an offline search engine came to him while he
was travelling in a train with some friends and could not find a way to access Google.

Magic number 5544, the number for his search engine which can be accessed at
Re 1 per SMS. The software he has developed is wired to search the Web for any SMS search query, from song lyrics to YouTube video links, and it generates an answer within 10 seconds of sending the SMS.

Survival strategy "I have picked this up from various people but I believe that if one wants to start a business, he or she must be ready to take risks. Be prepared for both the good and the bad," says Ravindran.

CARBON CAPITAL
BY PIERRE MARIO FITTER

Because he has developed an inexpensive technology that transforms harmful industrial carbon emissions into highly useful carbon nanotubes, a black powder-like material that lends structure and durability to products like rubber and steel. Because his technology not only reduces the threat of climate change, but it has also reduced the cost of making carbon nanotubes from $50 per gram to less than $1 per gram. Because small businesses like the Maruthi Modern Rice Mill in Thanjavur, which use his technology, are not only reducing pollution but are also earning money by selling carbon nanotubes they produce to auto and steel makers who use them. Because at 24, he is not resting on his laurels but is pursuing a PhD in material sciences at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University.

PEOPLE'S OFFICER
BY DEVESH KUMAR

Because he is among those bureaucrats who have used their position to bring administration closer to people and act as a bridge between the two. When working as the collector of Naxal-infested Bijapur district in Chhattisgarh, he earned the admiration of the local population for building a network of roads, power lines, a chain of pre-fabricated residential schools and hospitals in the violence-ravaged area. Because Kumar represents a new brand of intrepid, fearless young officers. He remained undeterred after an attempt on his life and continued doing what he had set out to do: Work for the welfare of poor tribals. Kumar's convoy was ambushed by Naxals in Bhopalpatnam on April 20, a day before the then Sukma Collector Alex Paul Menon was abducted.

In a state where all five newspapers are owned by politicians, he challenged the establishment by starting his own newspaper, Sentinel Arunachal, in 2010 in collaboration with the Sentinel Group of Assam. Because his newspaper did not hesitate to criticise even his own brother, the then chief minister Jarbom Gamlin. Today, his group is the largest media house in terms of revenue and manpower in Arunachal Pradesh. Because the graduate from Shri Ram College of Commerce,Delhi University, has emerged as one of the leading voices among the youth of the North-east.

He sees the stage as an akhada.
