BASU

ADVISE AND CONSENT
n early front-runner in the race to succeed the truth-prone Kaushik Basu as chief economic adviser is MIT professor Abhijit Banerjee. The Government has been trying to lure Banerjee, an expert on poverty, and co-author of the bestselling Poor Economics, into joining Planning Commission as a member. It will certainly improve its poverty estimates. But he may prefer the more significant job of chief economic adviser. Like Basu, Banerjee has no previous experience in Government and is a specialist in microeconomics. Perfect equation.

A

n the first flush of enthusiasm, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav announced he would hold a `janata darshan' every week at his official home. But after 10,000 people from across the state turned up to meet him on April 18 at 5, Kalidas Marg in Lucknow, he's changed his mind. There are only so many problems his government can promise instant redress for. Now the durbar will be held twice a month, on the first and third Wednesday.

TELLY VISION
amata Banerjee has a new fan: Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi. Much like his West Bengal counterpart, Gogoi now plans to launch a TV channel for his government to present the `official' side of stories. He was annoyed with the coverage of the ULFA bandh on April 20, the day Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Guwahati. "The channels created the impression that Assam is controlled by ULFA commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah," said Gogoi. The Congress party in the state already has an `official' channel in News Live, owned by Riniki Bhuyan Sarma, wife of Health and Education Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Gogoi's most trusted man. Clearly, one is not enough.

WHAT'S ODD
Markandey Katju has written to Kapil Sibal, asking him to set up a panel so that social media can be regulated to prevent "irreparable damage" to individuals. Odd, given that he was an enthusiastic, albeit brief, presence on Twitter with the cool handle mark_katju and a KatjuFanClub which religiously relays his writings.

WHAT'S HOT
Names for who will be next president. The latest long shots, according to The Wall Street Journal, are Chief Election Commissioner S.Y. Quraishi and actor Amitabh Bachchan.

ART OF SAYING NOTHING
n April 23, a day before the Parliament session O began, the group of ministers on media called a press conference. Kapil Sibal, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Pawan Bansal and V. Narayanasamy faced questions. Did they set Delhi on fire with their answers? Well, no. Try this:

ohan Bhagwat's April 19 visit to a V.D. Savarkar memorial in Mumbai ended with him displaying his shooting skills. The officials of the memorial took the RSS chief to an indoor shooting range and gave him a rifle, last used by shooter Anjali Bhagwat to win at the 2003 Munich World Cup, to try his skills. To their surprise, Bhagwat, who headed RSS's physical training department for almost a decade, hit the target. Now, if only BJP would do as well during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

On the Lokpal Bill
"The PM called a meeting of all the floor leaders in the Rajya Sabha and tried to narrow down the differences. Still, six issues remain over which there are differences." --V. Narayanasamy Congress leader

JHARKHAND ROUTE TO RAJYA SABHA
he CBI probe into businessman R.K. Agrawal's associate, who was caught with Rs 2.15 crore on March 30, led to the countermanding of Rajya Sabha polls in Jharkhand.That has, for now, closed the much-in-demand K.D. Singh route to political respectability. Unlike in the past, independents have stayed away from the ongoing Rajya Sabha poll process. CBI is also probing the Rajya Sabha poll held in Jharkhand in 2010, which has led Congress MLA Chandrashekhar Dubey to allege that a Rajya Sabha MP from his party offered Rs 25 lakh as bribe to legislators then.Ahem. But how does he know?

BHAGWAT AT THE MEMORIAL
