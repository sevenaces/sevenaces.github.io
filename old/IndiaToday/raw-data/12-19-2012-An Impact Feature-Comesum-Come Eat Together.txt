PLANNING FOR A SUNDAY BRUNCH...
ecause it's a Sunday, the Fio Brunch is to be savored with a relaxed stomach. The menu is designed to pamper yourselves. Our menu evolves from the Country Italian, pastas-al1 dente with a choice, grills to order, salads tossed in front, live wood fired thin crust pizza with accompanying augratins and prime vegetables. On the Indian compliment we follow rustic lines with regional street food from Punjab to Rajasthan to Malabar. The desserts are Italian wiped to Indian, Phirnis and kulfis. The seasonal fruit appears in sangrias and mojitos and as also in salads and desserts. The refreshing flavors and colors is the order of menu making for a winter brunch. The seasonal such as Sarso Ka Saag or Gajerella are a luring must, such as in Italian it is the fresh fish, smoked meats and fresh herbs. The overall atmosphere besides food should be relaxed and fun. For this we layout non-uniform seating plan with soft live instrumental such as Piano or a Saxophone. A true unwinding experience lies at Fio - Country Kitchen and Bar. Every Winter Sunday Brunch.

here's something about the place that it's always packed to full capacity. We spent time there to crack the formula. It could be the taste of their Chinese that is just right. Or the fact that they are constantly re-inventing themselves with each new outlet that they open. Perhaps their customers love the fact that they keep stirring in freshness with new dish-introductions, or their on going festival like Thai Festival, Oodles of Noodles, or The Clay Pot one that stole the show. Ask the old timers who reminsce the signature drink of Berco's - Fruit Beer. A nonalcoholic concoction that can give a high with the very thought of it. In terms of the dishes the classics are Crispy Chilli Potatoes, Sliced Fish in Mustard Sauce and Crispy Lamb. The helpings at Berco's are wholesome and satiating in more ways than one can imagine. It's the combination of taste and quantity, which explains why everyone perceives it as a value for money place. Collectively all these ingredients create a memorable taste that can only be described in one word...BERCO'S!
