WISDOM OF WIT

Laughter in the Time of Cholera
amata Banerjee and the PMO don't agree on a lot of things. But they might both agree with the blind librarian in Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose who destroys Aristotle's treatise on laughter because it might undermine the authority of the Church. All authority figures and institutions--from the cartoonallergic Trinamool chief to the PMO with its aversion to tweets that lampoon it--frown upon the joke, realising that in its power to subvert the established order the pun is often mightier than the sword. However, like a rubber ball that bounces back higher the harder it is thrown, humour frustrates censorship, including the ultimate censorship of death. In Romain Gary's The Dance of Genghis Cohn, the eponymous protagonist, a Jewish comedian, presents his bare bottom to a Nazi firing squad, exhorting his executioners to come and kiss it. By this seemingly futile gesture of defiance the hapless victim turns the tables on his killers. Cohn's soul leaves his body and comes to roost within the Nazi officer commanding the firing squad. The parable of Genghis Cohn underlines the use

of laughter as an instrument of liberation. As Hannah Arendt and others writing about the Holocaust have stressed, language assumes progressive importance as the conditions it seeks to describe become increasingly unspeakable; silence represents the irreversible triumph of the oppressor. Of all forms of communication which bear witness to the embattled human condition, perhaps none is as potent as laughter. Laughter is the revenge of the ant against the elephant which tries to stomp it into oblivion, the incongruity of the act exerting the force of a moral ju-jitsu to throw the disproportionately powerful aggressor into ridicule. A distinction must be made between slapstick and satire. Slapstick is a man slipping on a banana peel; satire is when the man slipping on a banana skin is the corrupt municipal official, who has been cutting corners on garbage removal, and now has been hoist with his own petard, or peel. Satire is humour with a moral cutting edge and walks the tightrope between the individual and the collective, freedom and necessity, faith and anguish, the mask of comedy that slips to show the grinning skull beneath the skin. Paronomasia, or punning, the so-called lowest form of wit, exemplifies the dual nature of satire. At its best, the pun acts as a semantic zip fastener to bring together opposing and apparently contradictory elements to form an unseamly--pun intended--whole which is larger and more meaningful than the sum of its parts, a gestalt in which jest is revealed as truth, and vice versa. The resultant tension seeks release via the safety valve of laughter, which often with pain is fraught. If satire is often cruel, it is so because life is cruel. If cruelty--including the last twist of the knife, Think which is that of our of death as a mortality--were to drastic way of be taken from it, cutting down on life might be worth expenses. living, but it would no longer be worth

satirising. Which would be a pity, if one accepts the definition of the human animal as a creature whose humanity consists of his capacity to laugh and to cry, and not always to know the one from the other. The function of satire, of laughing because we seem no longer to be able to weep, becomes all the more crucial in what are euphemistically called `troubled times', when more than ever our common humanity is at stake. The darker and more dangerous the times, the blacker and more defiant the humour that rises up to confront them. "Apart from that, Mrs Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?" The reference is to Abraham Lincoln who was assassinated while watching a stage performance. Lincoln was shot in 1865, in the politically surcharged atmosphere following the end of the American Civil War. The wars in West Asia, African famines, the death of Princess Diana, all fomented a sub-culture of gallows humour.

It's based on the therapeutic principle that a judiciously administered dose of the poison that made you ill can make you feel better. Like ethnic jokes, `sick' humour is deplored as being `politically incorrect'. This is to understate the case. `Sick' jokes Far from being an elitist affectation, graveyard humour are meant to illustrate the incorrectness of the politics that have brought you to the grief from which you now seek de- has its recognised place in diverse societies.

Initially shocked, I laughed when the adults began to laugh. I learnt early that anti-war remedy is not pious bromides but black humour. In Joseph Heller's Catch-22, the protagonist, Yosarian, death fills the living with shame, from which we seek regoes around naked in the army base. He hopes that this lease in laughter.

It is not a reaction to the men would want to fight a war, madness is not a valid scheme of things, but an abreaction, an exorcism of the argument for dismissal from combat service. That's the very real fears and anxieties, the despair and the suffering `Catch-22' underlying the war conducted by other means that those who would silence laughter would have us believe are our inescapable lot. that we call black humour. With our backs against the wall, shoulder-to-shoulder Sex and death, the primal polarities, have long been the subjects of subversive humour, as exemplified by with Genghis Cohn, we can either acquiesce in our victimiWoody Allen ("Think of death as a drastic way of cutting sation by accepting the condemned man's blindfold, or we down on expenses"), among others.
