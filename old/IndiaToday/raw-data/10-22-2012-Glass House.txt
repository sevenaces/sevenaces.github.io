BENEVOLENT BADAL

P

unjab's Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal was recently the chief guest at his alma mater, The Lawrence School, Sanawar. He donated Rs 1 crore from Punjab's development fund to the school in Himachal Pradesh. In the consequent uproar, another gift went unnoticed. At the school's founder's day, it is the chief guest's discretion to fix the number of holidays the students can take after the celebrations are over. Most add an extra day to the allocated three-day holiday. Caught up in the moment, Badal gave the students 10 days off. He certainly knows how to please the crowd--in this case, future voters.

Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh and Congress General Secretary Oscar Fernandes were recently spotted having coffee at a five-star hotel in Delhi. Now what could the two have in common apart from the fact that Fernandes belongs to Karnataka, the same state as Vijay Mallya, the owner of an ailing Kingfisher Airline?

THROWING IN THE TOWEL
MK chief M. Karunanidhi underwent a wardrobe change. The white shirt and yellow towel was replaced with a black shirt and white towel for a brief spell, but he is back to wearing white again. Reason? Astrology, say insiders.

RAHUL HAS TIME, NOT KASHMIR

ongress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi, who led a delegation of India's top corporate bigwigs to Srinagar on October 5, was stumped for an answer during a luncheon meeting with local entrepreneurs at Srinagar's Taj Vivanta Hotel. During the informal table talk, he was asked how long would it take to resurrect the private sector in Jammu and Kashmir. A cautious Rahul replied that it would take time, even if business giants like the Tatas and Birlas agree RAHUL (RIGHT) WITH RATAN TATA to invest in the state. This pragmatic answer did not appeal to 30-year-old Shazia Bakshi, who heads a successful travel business in the Valley. She exclaimed impatiently "I don't have time! We young people want to enjoy life now." Ah, but what does Rahul know about the power of now.

SHOTGUN FITNESS
lean Shatrughan Sinha made a surprise entry at an Uzbek food festival at the Broadway Hotel in Srinagar on October 5. Visibly frail after his recent cardiac bypass surgery, the inimitable Bihari Babu made a rare deviation from his strict, doctor-recommended diet with a plateful of tandoori fish. Clearly revelling in his post-surgery transformation, he says: "I plan on staying like this." This is one physique, we hope, that will stay this way. SINHA

IN THE FLUSH OF CONTROVERSY

RAMESH

nly Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh can make a clarification sound worse than the original. On October 7, he was asked about his controversial remark that toilets are more important than temples. This is what he offered as an explanation: "Toilets are important for any person after getting up in the morning." Congress spokespersons have refused to comment saying it was the minister's personal view and he was the best person to defend it. Er, maybe not.

BHUJBAL, THE RETURN COAT
aharashtra PWD Minister Chhagan Bhujbal had stopped wearing his trademark black jacket ever since Ajit Pawar replaced him as deputy chief minister in 2010. The flamboyant leader surprised everyone at the Cabinet meeting on October 4 when he arrived with his sleeveless jacket back on. Was he hoping it would act as a lucky charm and help him win back the deputy chief minister's chair, vacant since Pawar resigned? One has heard of political turncoats but this one is a return coat.
PRASADA SCINDIA

MISSING
aghuram Rajan, recently appointed chief economic adviser, was conspicuous by his absence at the Government's annual interaction with economic editors on October 8. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram was present along with the ministry's top brass. Rajan took office on August 29 but has reportedly spent most of his time away in the US attending seminars.

he Congress is looking high and low for the Rahul Brigade, the team of young MPs who are part of Rahul Gandhi's charmed circle. None of them has turned up on TV channels to defend allegations against Robert Vadra even though most of them are part of the recently constituted team of spokesmen. These include Jyotiraditya Scindia, Ajay Maken, Sachin Pilot, M.M. Pallam Raju, Milind Deora, Jitin Prasad and RPN Singh. Neither has Rahul commented on the controversy. What's the matter boys--is Vadra too hot to handle?

LIGHTS OUT FOR MAYAWATI
owhere are signs of a change of guard in Uttar Pradesh more visible than at Kanshi Ram memorials that dot the state. In 2008, Mayawati had set up statues of her mentor at the Kanshi Ram memorial in Alambagh and in the posh Gomti Nagar area in Lucknow. During the BSP regime, these statues would be bathed in light on the occasion of Kanshi Ram's THE KANSHI RAM MEMORIAL death anniversary on October 9. Not so this year. Her successor, IN GOMTI NAGAR, LUCKNOW Akhilesh Yadav, even cancelled the annual holiday that Mayawati had declared on this day. For BSP, the message is clear: The power is off, quite literally.
