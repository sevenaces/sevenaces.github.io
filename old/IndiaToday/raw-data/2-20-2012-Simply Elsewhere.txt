Bengali thali at Kewpie's
The shukto comes first followed by vegetarian preparations, then the fish and meat. The meal is rounded off with chutney, papad, doi, mishti and paan. The Bengali thalas (plates) here have been a rage since Kewpie's opened its doors in 1998. Add to that the ambience of a traditional home with period furniture and Kewpie's legendary recipes--and you have a winning combination. Among the must haves are Palong Chhanar Malai Kofta, Kankrar Paturi and Kosha Mangsho. Average meal for two: Rs 650 plus taxes Where: 2 Elgin Lane Tel: 033 24861600; kewpieskitchen.com
