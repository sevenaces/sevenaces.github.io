Healthy children between the age group of 11 to 13 years can apply. The admission would be granted on the basis of national trials in the sports for which the child wishes to enrol.

The real formative years are between the age 10 to 15 years. Players must shape up by then and play some serious competive sports or else they have little chance of making it to the national or international levels. Students and their parents in the metro cities often struggle to balance between schooling and opportunities in competitive sports. Smaller cities simply do not have sports infrastructure. Hence some of the best sporting talent never comes to the fore. No wonder India, a country of 120 crore people, is not able to make its mark in the sports.

e help you find and figure out the regions and areas that you as a parent should look for your child. The things that a school should have in store for your child, the importance of the upgraded methods of teaching, the necessity to adopt them and lots more... CURRICULUM Programme & Methods It is not a denied fact that the course study should be the first priority of the school as well as the student. But there are numerous factors that derive the studying environment of a child. It is necessary to see that the school follows the course syllabus and guidelines of the Board to which it is affiliated. The Central Board (CBSE) for instance follows an entirely different course form as compared to the ICSE. The prescribed books henceforth should be the ones dictated by the concerned Board. Some schools for the stance of making profit over accommodate students in one class. The teacher - student ratio ideally should not be more than 1:30. Not only that, it should be seen that you don't fall prey to schools which have untrained teachers as their employees. According to the latest survey of the District Information System for Education (DISE), it was found that over 54.91% private schools had untrained teachers as compared to 44.88% in government schools. So it is crucial that your child is not quarry to such incidents. The teachers to tackle the problems and needs of the students should adopt new and innovative ideas that would make the class more interesting and fun filled for your child. Adapting to student friendly techniques like showing live presentations, taking other technical aids and not sticking to the four walled rooms by taking them

out for educational excursions, trips, etc can build and create a different mind set and a level of understanding in the students mind. Not only this, the school should make their students participate in various competitive exams, Olympiads and competitions giving them the feel of the competitive world around and accordingly prepare for them. THE Co - Curricular Dynamics Falling outside the realm of the daily curriculum and getting oneself out of the bookish world, it is necessary that your child involves himself in the cocurricular activities. The school for different classes organizes different types and levels of activities. Your child's school should be the one that would organize various competitions like say Fancy Dress, Story Telling, Poetry Recitation, etc for him. It should conduct weekly classes of various sports like taekwondo or karate, swimming, horse riding, yoga, etc ensuring that your child is involved in both mental and physical activities. It should help bring out your child's sports talents and groom the skills by properly training and coaching him/her. The school should timely ^organize various tournaments like cricket, basketball, football, tennis, etc. Whereas on the cultural front the school should engage your child in music, dance, various musical instruments, arts, drama, etc leaving no stones unturned in ensuring that no talent or skill of your child is left out undiscovered. This kind of exposure at a very young age makes your child strong both mentally and physically and prepares them well to tackle the problems on their own. It helps in building up the morale of the child psychologically and gives a helping hand in the overall development and growth of the child. Services & Facilities A child spends around six to eight

The primary sections of the school should have one or two care takers who maintain and takes care the needs of the children. With increasing crimes in the capital and the NCR regions, it has become essential that even schools upgrade their security levels. Deploying security staffs and installing Closed Circuit Televisions (CCTV) is necessary to ensure the safety of the school staff and students.

The basic computer lessons are already included in the courses but the authorities must ensure that the software or the other computer languages your child is taught are timely updated and the new versions are obtained as soon as they are launched in the market. This gives your child an edge over others who don't comply with it.

· Playing arena is important for the kids. Hence, a big playground is a must and also a smaller playing area for small kids having swings for the children and place for having various fun filled activities for them.

With the technology taking an upper hand over everything, it is important that even schools adopt and integrate these technologies in their classrooms. Though accommodating and setting up these latest technologies may involve high budget, there are small IT companies who find a solution to this problem. They help in setting up the smart class rooms and e-learning programmes relatively at a low cost. It should be understood that using these technological aids will help in increasing the efficiency and level of understanding of your child as these appear to be more appealing and interesting to them at this age.

While the classical view restricts education to just academics, as most of us believe too, but the scope and definition of education in 21st century encompasses the whole learner as knowledgeable, understanding, co-operating & collaborating while maintaining a healthy balance between the material and spiritual. Education would therefore, seek to transcend literacy, knowledge and skills, as it goes well beyond equipping a learner to handle the challenges of living together and sharing natural and material resources and developing an innate ability to address and resolve conflicts.
or the learner in 21st century, the agility of a committed learner, the adroitness of a skilled athlete, the eloquence of a capable speaker, the valour of an adventurer and the inquisitiveness of a free-spirited entrepreneur as they boldly step out of the classroom to experiment with technology, dabble with science and nature while at the same time get a good grasp of their course knowledge and structure through research, observation and data collection. As always, we look back to the future. Probably, answers for the future trends in education also point to our own history of Gurukuls that produced fairly well rounded humans. Those attending Gurukuls not only learnt vedas - providing insight into science, mathematics, astronomy, environment, they also trained in martial arts like fencing, horse riding, tent pegging, etc and above all imbibed 'dharma1 -values and ethics. And centuries later, as a carry over, Benjamin Bloom, an American educational psychologist, teacher, thinker and reformer spoke of three 10 | AnlfTlPAC limitative TH GOOD SCHOOL 6UiD£

domains of human learning; cognitive (Learning), psychomotor (physical development) and affective (values, attitudes and ethics). Bloom's Taxonomy, today forms the basis of any discussion or discourse on the future of education. The International Baccalaureate Organization based in Geneva further defines the profile of the learner thus; Inquirers; lifelong learners in a spirit of inquiry and research. Knowledgeable; Explore concepts, ideas and issues acquiring in-depth knowledge & understanding across a range of disciplines. Thinkers; Critical, creative and Ethical. Effective Communicators, Principled; They act with integrity and honesty, fairness, justice and respect. Openminded; Sensitive to cultures, history and perspectives, values and traditions of others. Caring; They show empathy, compassion and respect towards others. Risk-takers; Driven by courage and forethought and self belief. Balanced; Intellectually, physically and emotionally.

does it take to provide opportunities of learning, imbibing, fostering and shaping. What and who influences - Formally or informally; the growth of learner, across continents, cultures, languages and regions. There is sufficient data and evidence now available by way of school test surveys that not only assess the student learning but also is able to take stock of the variations in social, cultural and educational environments. Comparisons very strongly suggest the role of factors that define quality schooling. One such test survey is PISA, Program for International Student Assessment, an organ of OECD that conducts tests, once every four years, in around 60 countries where 15 year olds participate in language, mathematics and science tests. The other being TIMSS, Trends in Mathematics & Science Studies, conducted by IEA at grade IV [around 10 year olds] and VIII [around 14 year olds] levels. These test results are compiled and compared against various indicators so to understand how and why some school systems perform better than others. The analysis provides countries with enough data and evidence to attempt reforms in their respective countries. Based on the quantitate test data of PISA survey 2007, McKinsey & Co, a leading consultancy reported that Finland, Korea, Singapore were amongst the top performing countries in schools education. As for the factors; amongst several ranging from policy, communities, practice, infrastructure to rewards & compensations responsible for good showing, the report concluded thus: The experience of these top school systems suggests that three things matter most: 1. Getting the right people to become teachers 2. Developing them into effective instructors and 3. Ensuring that the system is able to deliver the possible instruction for every child. This almost tasks us with redefining and reinventing the teacher, who at the very least must be committed, competent and compassionate. Most teachers view teaching as a subsidiary part-time vocation, working half days and remaining confined to the text book. Poor compensation, bleak career progression, lack of challenge and recognition are amongst several reasons why teaching does not attract the best of the university graduates. Confounded further by the grossly underperforming B.Ed, a teacher preparation professional program, India continues to struggle with pre-service and inservice professional development with pathetic results. The last two CTET [Central Teacher Eligbility Tests] and state level TET showed that a mere 7% of the B.Ed qualified teachers were able to clear the test. Undoubtedly, we face formidable challenges in the area of policy and practice. The need for systemic reforms is urgent. McKinsey report concludes: on capacity building and empowerment such that teacher could devise strategies, build plans and use tools for effective transactions in their classrooms. TeacherSITY noticed a marked preference for 'notes' and readymade templates that could be used in their classrooms without having to create their own. Despite exhortations that there could be several ways of doing the right things, teachers wanted trainers to tell them just one right way to teach, thus avoiding the necessary rigor! Teachers cannot foster creativity & innovation unless they have it all themselves? - TeacherSITY finally concluded that it was a challenge of a culture shift more than any training, capacity building or empowerment. Preservice or In service training must necessarily comprise of not just skills and competencies, but more importantly of the right attitudes and perceptions of teaching as a profession. It must aim at building compassionate teachers deeply interested in their pupils, competent and innovative enough to recreate content beyond the text books, relevant to the learner and in sync with the environment, use multiple and appropriate strategies to engage the learner, develop a corrective, instead of punitive approach in dealing with disruptive behavior, know what and how of assessment & evaluation, instead of being judgmental use every assessment opportunity to benchmark learning and charter learning course thereon. Teachers must understand and appreciate that they are undisputed leaders in their classrooms. As Haim Ginott, a celebrated Jew teacher notes in his famous book, 'Between Teacher and Child'; "I've come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element in the classroom. It's my daily mood that makes the weather. As a teacher, I possess tremendous power to make a child's life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration. I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis will be escalated or de-escalated and a child humanized or de-humanized." The next time the parents go looking for a 'good1 school, they must look for teachers, knowledgeable, creative & innovative, compassionate & humane, understanding & appreciative, instead of palatial buildings or air-conditioned classrooms. It is these early years spent at school that makes children what they finally become in their lives - private and professional.

developing strong processes for selecting and training teachers, paying good starting compensation, and carefully managing the status of the teaching professions. Above all, the top performing systems demonstrate that the quality of an education system depends ultimately on the quality of its teachers.1
Like any other professional, teachers need to look at their vocation as a demanding engagement on a full time basis and that requires them not only to continuously update themselves on content and pedagogy of not just the subject they teach, but all other subjects, that integrated learning may demand. Teachers are no longer looked upon as mere pedagogues; they are friends, guides, mentor and above all, role models and leaders. The new National Curriculum Framework expects teachers to switch to activity based teaching, project based & integrated learning, fostering attitudes and imbibing values. But is it happening yet? Does our crowded syllabus provide for enough time and space for even the willing teachers to do that? Is'nt there information overload already? Isn't all our assessment and evaluation oriented towards information recall? Does our pre-service teacher preparation and in-service professional development geared towards creating empowered teachers? And above all, are we getting the right kind of people to become teachers?

he effects of the digital revolution will be felt nowhere more than in education, as we prepare the first wired generation in the history of mankind. If it has taken time for the impact of this paradigm shift to register, it is only for the years it takes to fully educate a child and the lacuna in rolling out the technology apparatus to the entire population of children, and therefore schools, at one go. However, the critical link in the entire process is the Teacher, who must first be made proficient in its use and practice before it can be made useful for students. This is where a significant challenge faces us for it requires a serious modification in established systems of While the concept of technology in education is not so new anymore, its adoption in India by schools of all types still is.

digital style requires a huge mindset change for teachers. Getting teachers' buy-in to use technology for imparting learning is important and not so easy at the same time. While younger teachers might find it easier to transition to technology-based teaching and using digital tools, it may not be so for the more mature teachers who have been using the conventional teaching methods for years. A lot of them in India may have never even used a computer so expecting them to adopt digital tools overnight will not happen. This doesn't mean the teachers lack the will or skill to take up technologybased teaching. It simply means that as it happens with any new product or service, there will be innovators, early adopters as well as laggards. At the same time, preparing six million teachers across the country for technology-based teaching is no mean task. It also means the solution can't be one-size-fits-all. It has to be a gradual, step-bystep approach of: · Building awareness about technology and how it can benefit teachers as well as students, · Generating an interest about the various types of digital tools so that teachers seek more information about them, making them more familiar and comfortable with technology, · Evaluating digital tools, their features, pedagogy, and associated content to understand how it can benefit the teaching and learning processes. This will require a trial-run on using the digital products in a real-life school setting by involving teachers, students and parents, · And finally, training the teachers professionally to get them hands-on with digital tools so that one, they become comfortable with technology, and two, they can use it most effectively to impart learning. A number of educational companies, NGOs and government organizations have launched teachertraining programs for technology adoption. These countries like the United States, technology trainings go far beyond telling teachers how to adoption by schools is not so ubiquitous. While they switch a tablet on/off or what its features and have progressed beyond the question of how, India applications are. These trainings cover more is still grappling with it. On one hand is the complicated things like behavioural changes and apparent huge cost of installing technology in the challenges that teachers face in adapting to classrooms, on the other is training the most digitized methods of teaching. important element in this whole chain - the The Golden Triangle approach - Involving Teachers, teachers - on integrating technology in their Technology and Students Equally teaching process and imparting it successfully to A thorough and consistent exposure of teachers to students. The former is being covered to a large technological devices and how they can be used in extent by education companies as most of them delivering instruction is essential in building work on the build-own-operate-transfer model. The effective pedagogical practices. Educomp's Golden latter requires a lot more than just addressing the Triangle approach is where the technology, teacher financials. and student, all three are equally involved in the Training the trainer... process of imparting and receiving education. It is a Transitioning from a conventional chalkboardsetup where the teacher learns to exhaust teaching style of teaching to the technology-oriented technology efficiently in designing lessons that embrace all kinds of learners. As an outcome to such a training teachers become proficient not only with technology but also with tools on how to deliver technology centric lessons and make full use of the technology tools in the school. Such training is not long-drawn process and can be done in about a month . It is effective only if followed by continuous technical support to teachers to help them with their daily classroom requirements and challenges. Virtual support in the form of networking sites, discussion groups, online training modules, media broadcasts, email communities, etc, is equally important for 24x7 learning and training. Regular access to the equipment that they will utilize in classrooms is also a must. On their part, teachers have to make efforts to stay connected and interact more with their students to be able to gauge their needs better and hence design more effective technology-based teaching sessions. Educomp has partnered with numerous corporates and NGOs to implement top-class teacher-training projects to prepare educators and make them proficient in integrating technology in classrooms. Our teacher-training workshops empower teachers by imparting them skills in areas like enquiry-based learning, building problem solving skills among students, creative thinking, and effective communication and assessment strategies. It trains them in things like lesson planning, managing environment and time and motivating students. We have exclusive teacher training centers that are located in over 20 locations in India. These centers provide technology training to over 140,000 teachers in India and are working extensively with the Ministry of Human Resource Development for initiating teacher training projects in urban and rural schools across the country. We have also worked with the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti and Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan. The mission is to equip teachers with latest technology and help them effectively implement instructional strategies that can cater to different needs of diverse set of learners so that they can learn better. On an average, a school can factor in for about 20% of its hardware and software cost for teacher training over the life of the usage of the equipment and software . It may appear to be quite a bit initially, but most educational companies build in this cost as part of the overall project. It is important to understand that all initiatives and expenditure by a school or educational institution can go waste if there are no trained teachers. Without training the trainer, imparting technologybased learning in classrooms can be nothing more than a mere fantasy, something like purchasing a car without knowing how to drive.

he fundamental principle is to inculcate values of honesty, compassion and respect along with academic success. As education policies move from an emphasis on process to a stronger emphasis on the results of the education processes, learning outcomes have come to be seen as an essential feature of a good school. Responsibility is a notion which has become a moral cornerstone of our times and a central concern in every society. Citizenship and human rights education are among society's strongest defences against the rise of violence, discrimination and intolerance. Hence introducing teaching methods that stimulate the development of critical thinking and problem solving skills in students, renovating schools to provide better learning environments, and expanding access to computer and internet technologies is of paramount importance. Enrichment programmes for the teaching faculty would keep them abreast of the latest pedagogic practices that underpin holistic education. The good school provides the most amicable

ambience for all its students so that they effortlessly blend into the intricacies and complexities of an adult life, graduating from the innocent and unquestioning portals of childhood to become 'the doubters'and therefore the discovery and invention agents of their times. Developing the capacity and courage to face realities and challenges is yet another mission on which modern schools have embarked. Leadership and learning are indispensible to each other. Character training is fostered by the environment we create and opportunities we offer. Discipline, I believe, must be based on example and self control. Students should be given the opportunity to handle responsibilities and make decisions. In order to accomplish this, conduct standards must be clearly laid down and students be helped to set goals for improvement. In an age when leisure is recognized as essential for development, its good use is an indication of good education. Thus it is a compelling reason for each school to offer structured sports programme and spirit building co curricular activities to encourage pursuit of excellence. Knowledge by itself has no value; it is like a dictionary filled with words. It is fortunate that a modern day parent seeks a 'school' that imparts 'real education'- an institution that guarantees a safe and secure environment to its upcoming pioneers so as to facilitate and guide their growth and progress in life as they march confidently and gallantly towards achieving their lofty goals and accomplishing their preferred future aspirations. The good school fosters and refines the innate qualities of each child so as to fashion out an ideal human being, capable and willing to play his part for betterment of human race-a global citizen.

the
rs ago S. Mehtab Singh felt that an essential growth to the community could come only through quality education and also realizing, that it had to be at an affordable cost and thus be available to all sections of society. He felt that every man and woman should accept individual responsibility for the survival of all. He set about bringing up Schools, where curriculums were designed, to develop abilities and skills, (rather than memories) in children. S. Mehtab Singh and Sardarni Jasbir Kaur laid emphasis on self-less service, rendered in a spirit of total devotion to the Guru (in whose sacred name the School is) and the True Lord. They enrolled the whole family and who all adorn the annals of the 'Intellectual Heritage', with their dedicated and pro-active beings. S. Mehtab Singh

Chairman

was an M.A. Economics from the Forman Christian College of Lahore and was selected for a fellowship at the London School of Economics. He conceptualized and actualized the mission of setting up quality meccas of education, and was the vision behind the setting up of Public Schools in the Sikh community besides Public Schools in Delhi, Hansi, Kota, Dehradun, etc. He shaped his vision with the spiritual leaders of his time and the outcome of which is the School at Bathinda, the Engineering College at Malout, the College of Nursing at Ludhiana and the Home for the Aged at Delhi. Sardarni Jasbir Kaur was a Graduate and Gyani from Rawalpindi and was a woman with a focused purpose and a doer and much attached to the traditions and richness of Sikh culture and the Guru's thoughts. She inculcated a rich heritage of the Guru's thoughts in her family and which has helped in continuing their vision. The nucleus of all other schools of Mussoorie with its palatial buildings, extensive grounds, highly qualified staff & brilliant achievements, in the field of education & sports, houses the girls school and junior section (boys upto classs III) in Shangri-La estate & boys in the Vincent Hill campus. The school provides state of'd' art facilities. Be it the infrastructures modern amenities, e-class rooms, resource centers, catering or entertainment. Today, the Schools are chaired by S. Jaspal Singh, Chairman, who is ably assisted by Members of the Governing body. The academic direction is well supported by Sardarni Amrit Kaur Sabhharwal, a qualified and highly experienced academician, Sardarni Jasleen Kaur, Sardarni Jaswinder Kaur, Sardarni Gurvinder Kaur, Mr. M.PSingh, Mr. Amarpal Singh Sabharwal, Mr. IP Singh Merita and a Honorary Advisory Body - all leading scholars, who are leaders in their field, including Mr. Tarlochan Singh, Ex-Member of Parliament. GNFCS today devises new curriculums to teach concepts and not only subjects and builds the curriculum around three core concepts of: Awareness, Honesty Responsibility. It is endeavoured to learn how to get along, become tolerant, not to hurt others and to see others as equal. GNFCS also endeavours to bring around the quality of believing in yourself and walking in dignity. We endeavour to teach what it means to be honest; we teach what it is to be responsible; we teach what it means to be aware of other people's feelings and respectful of other people's path. The Faculty is motivated to prepare a value-based curriculum and the wealth is in the question and not in the answer. Counseling effort is provided along with the parents. As a primary rule - in creating the child's system of values and to encourage students from the earliest age, until the end of formal education, to aspire such values and to learn how to use them, apply them, function like them and yes, even to question them. One of the most difficult decisions that all parents have to take is to select the right School for their Child.

The parents envisage a future and send their child to the School of their choice. No other social institution, perhaps, is bound by, or burdened with such responsibility as a School is. We of the Guru Nanak Fifth Centenary School, are conscious of and alive to our responsibility, towards the children, whose education has been entrusted to us. We are thankful to God, for having allowed us to dwell here in an environment that is most salubrious. We are fortunate to have spacious dormitories with modern facilities, bright big dining halls, well-lit and airy classrooms, well equipped laboratories and libraries, spacious playing fields and big covered gymnasiums. We are grateful to Him for having given us, all that we need to keep the children healthy and happy. Imparting education to every child under our charge, is the duty, that we owe to our God and Guru. We train him for a future, that yields no scope for uncertainties. Inculcating an aesthetic sense, a sharp common sense, an enlightened outlook in life and a desire to attain near perfection in everything that a CENTONIAN has to take up, is our constant endeavor. We train him to be a successful man of the world, without forgetting His mercies. We teach him never to be oblivious to his duties, as a human being. We remind him never to lose grace in defeat and always to be magnanimous in victory. It might sound idealistic. Yet, education devoid of idealism, is sure to lose something, which this world and mankind need. We dedicate ourselves to all this and remind ourselves of Rudyard Kipling's words, that shall always remain refreshingly relevant "Of all things in the world, there is nothing, always, excepting a good mother, so worthy of honor as a good school". We work in partnership with the staff & make it our responsibility to ensure that our school is a happy environment, in which children can work and play. We aim for highest achievement in establishing a solid base for the preparation of a useful adult life. We perform a vital function in developing expectations and capabilities, from the earliest age.

About Multiplexes and Boarding- Schools
Late 80's and through the closing of 20* century, the conventional cinema hall was replaced by the televison and with the dawn of the 21st century the cinema hall has reincarnated in new shape & substance - the multiplex. Like the television in drawing rooms, good and viable private schools have mushroomed ail across the country. They may not quite match the holistic development model of Boarding Schools, but provide enough of an academic rigour for students to connect with life beyond school.

T

he conventional boarding schools are in the midst of a cinematic metamorphosis. They are no longer the preferred options, unless of course the parents and children have some compelling reasons and there could be several. But, they surely are not the preferred scholastic destinations. And as the race hots up and competition stiffens, the performance and success at the board examinations or NT JEE has become more important than the pursuit of knowledge. The schooling has become more focused; its purpose shifting from

preparation for life to success at the school end entrance examinations - connecting with higher education. It is move away from Learning to 'Be1 to Learning to 'Become1. Education has thus come to mean, academic performance to the exclusion of its other essential constituents; skills, attitudes and values, it runs contrary to the very macro design of education wherein education and success, in life & profession, are co-extensive and without these three, schooling could well be half-baked. At another level, the new phenomenon; the withering of joint family and emergence of nuclear

family, gender issues, fragile marriages, broken homes or with both parents working, especially in the metros, the children are not able to get enough attention during their most formative and adolescent years. The high levels of pollution and near absence of any physical and sporting infrastructure in the new age day schools, the city children miss out enormously on the healthy mind in a healthy body opportunity. Obesity amongst children would soon be a common infliction. Distractions of living in a city draws most children astray from their fundamental goal of preparing for life through school years.

FOCUS Just as the multiplexes, this then, is a huge opportunity of boarding schools to reinvent themselves and re-position themselves. Given their quality infrastructure and support systems they could offer high quality academics in addition to the conventional 'holistic development' model.
Chairman emeritus Infosys, NR Narayana Murthy's, address at the 'Pan III' summit in New York in October 2011, clearly underlined the deterioration of quality of students entering Indian Institutes of Technology [Ills]. He said the majority of the students fare poorly at jobs and global institutions of higher education. He also lamented the poor English speaking and social skills of a majority of I IT students, "An IITian has to be a global citizen and must understand where the globe is going," he added. These remarks in the midst of the current debate sparked a nationwide response around improving student quality in terms of knowledge & understanding, life skills, attitudes and ethical values. It finally culminated in the T Ramasami committee report, recommending to the government of India, a clutch of changes in the design and conduct of the JEE. The report was examined at several levels and prompted changes in IIT entrance examinations effective 2013. The focus is back on the school, away from the standalone coaching & test-prep shops. And the boarding schools are best positioned to prepare high quality students for IITs and like institutions. As a top-line boarding school; Coeducational and International, in Dehradun has seized the initiative of the being first boarding school to offer test preparation for IIT-JEE. "It has combined the best of academic rigour, leveraging the best coaching institutes with the best of pastoral and personal care environments of the boarding schools and hopes to prepare the best of citizens and professionals for tomorrow's world", says Major General Basant Singh, the vice chairman of the SelaQui International School at Dehradun. It also offers high quality pastoral life, where students groom and develop; spiritually, intellectually, academically and physically, in addition to test preparation for admissions to eminent institutes offering undergraduate programs in engineering, law, accountancy and management. Adds the Headmaster, Mr. Rakesh Tomar. The competition extends beyond the sciences to Law, Liberal Arts, Commerce & Accountancy too. The National Law Universities, set up by almost every state demand a minimum qualifying level. Colleges like Shri Ram College of Commerce [SRCC] or the new program for preparation of chartered accounts under the The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Even in the field of competition sports, boarding schools have an edge over the day schools. I have come across students wanting to play tennis, cricket or any other game, traveling several hours a day to get some coaching and practice. Just consider the time loss in long commutes! What if the boarding schools can provide all of the sporting facilities under one roof? It might help create champions that India has yearned for. The sports associations, governments could come together, pool resources and convert some of the best boarding schools with rich sports infrastructure to become nurseries for future champions. While it may be re-invention opportunity for boarding schools, the days schools could well integrate the pastoral practices building life skills and extending school hours beyond the academic program to develop all of what the boarding schools can deliver. The issue is not one of comparative merit or who would survive. The opportunity is to learn for a variety of experience and pool them all together to build a generation of competent and committed learners. And finally, like the multiplexes, the boarding schools can bounce back as Centers of Excellence and 'Schools with a Purpose'.

Schools
India has a large range of Internationa! schools and some schools have been specifically designed to cater to the Expatriate students or the Indian students who return being born and experienced some years of education abroad. These students face a lot of challenges. The academic challenge faced by international students can be much greater than that of their peers. Confronted with academic change, culture shock, and homesickness, these students
can struggle to adjust to their new

surroundings, aiding strain to an otherwise difficult life transition.
26 I

tudents can also face problems when adjusting to new expectations in their academic settles. Schools overseas may have different expectations for homework, deadlines, paper format, citations, average workload, or communication with the instructor. International students may find it difficult to take on more work or shorter deadlines than they experienced in their home countries. Though the move to a new country might seem a great experience at first, many expatriates have a hard time getting things done in the beginning adapting to their new life abroad. Among children who repatriate, whether or not they return to their previous town or city, curriculum rarely matches, courses may be taught in a different sequence, and students may find that they lack prerequisites for classes they are about to take. Other children find that they have already read the books on their reading list, or may be ahead in foreign language. Teachers at home may be threatened by their advanced levels of

S

knowledge or simply may not know how to teach a child who is out of step with his or her classmates. For high school students, meeting exit requirements for graduation may not be possible, or may require significant negotiation or manipulation. Most of the Expatriates feel that the so called word International is a misnomer and the focus is more on International Infrastructure rather than the quality of education. After the initial hiccups they all settle down and once the honeymoon period is over they have to face the real classroom challenges Jolene Walvis, whose kids study in a top International School in Gurgaon, The first challenges were mainly the foreign language that was spoken at school, but (strangely enough) also dealing with the heat and air conditioning (never experienced that before), teachers wearing saris, having guards, having breakfast, lunch, and an Indian snack. Bringing your own (heavy) schoolbag was a new experience for our children as well as wearing a school uniform.1

FOCUS
I think the British and American schools are not very different here from what they are in the UK and America. The difference between Indian international schools and foreign international schools is (I think) that former place more emphasis on academic achievement and less on individual development.1 .India is on the brink of several changes and many private schools are moving towards what they call progressive education which entails more freedom to the child, independence and creativity is encouraged rather than rote learning but the challenge faced is the proper implementation of the same for which an intense training of the faculty is required. The challenges faced are many as shared by Uyen Waldon who relocated to Gurgaon from Sweden. The school uniform is a blessing! Not more fuss and fights in the morning regarding what to wear! The school here has so much better facilities and resources. The teachers are enthusiastic and engaging. The use of written school report even on as young children as in the pre-primary gives us parents a great insight in how the child is doing, not only academically but also socially, which is more important1. But theses expatriates say in one voice that in India children are often not allowed to do things because it makes their clothes dirty, they can break things, hurt themselves etc. When putting up a show or performance, the children are put aside in the name of perfection and the adults do all the planning and carrying out instead of involving the children, let them decide how the show should be etc. The focus here is more on the results rather than the efforts leading up to the results. A lot of these problems come from parents who seem to judge the school from how well and perfect the school shows and performances are rather than what part the kids have actually been taking'. They miss out the involvement of parents which is on a large scale abroad as In India we still believing closed door policy. This shift has to be there as we forget that parents are the partners in their child's education. Though they feel the faculty is warm and nice but- 'I think one of the differences in the Indian faculty and the ones in the US, is the 'I teach- you learn1 approach in India versus the let's learn together' approach in the US. This goes back to the way the way the teachers themselves have experienced education' says. Renu Ramakrishnan, who returned to India after living in the US for 21 years. Eric Jones is specially troubled by the lack of communication and transparency in schools. Vanita Konzelmann a working Expat mother wonders why in India we have holidays for each and every occasion, 'Frankly, it's very difficult to be a working Mom, with the number of holidays the school gives and many seemed unannounced' On a positive note, Gangsen Lee feels,' I feel that Curriculum and school education culture are different. However, since so many Indian students and teacher are in international schools, feeling of difference is not much.1 With the mushrooming of International schools we need to focus on not just the IB curriculum but paying attention to those small things which really matter and can make adjustment easier for an expatriate student.. .more parental involvement, focus on reaching out to that one child, bridging the language barrier, more transparency and more communication. Adjustment also becomes enjoyable and easier when schools provide facilities that these children were accustomed with .Sports like horse riding, swimming, gymnastics, track and field events, and golf that these schools offer engross students, enabling them to adjust quickly.

Established in 2005, Excelsior American School located in Gurgaon was envisaged as a different, distinct centre for learning. The school aims at giving education in its truest sense of word. Education that goes behind the confines of academics, moulding the child's personality, building up his moral character, instilling I a sense of responsibility, in .short helping children grow up into responsible citizens.

EXCELSIOR AMERICAN SCHOOL

SELF INSPIRED LEARNING
xcelsior American School, Gurgaon - a part of the chain of schools in Houston [Montessori School of Downtown] has initiated this process. Excelsior owes its genesis to the vision of its two main architects Ms. Rita- an eminent educationist and Mr. Hersh Kumar- a philanthropist and a passionate educator. The school strongly believes that curiosity, learning and developmental progression are inborn needs of children and early childhood education takes on new meaning when the child's natural curiosity is encouraged and rewarded. The school believes learning is a process in which each student discovers and constructs meaning from information and experience. The individual needs, background, and development level of each student serve as the starting point for all learning activities. The school follows the University of Cambridge IGCSE curriculum till Grade X and proposes to follow IB for class XI and XII in the coming year. "The IGCSE syllabus is broad-based and has a very strong stress on application-based learning. It lays emphasis on inculcating the spirit of enquiry. It teaches you to teach yourself as opposed to being taught. This approach is what makes it very special, not only for those planning to study abroad, but also for those who define education as the creation of an independent thinking mind", adds Mrs. Nambiar. In the Middle years the school offers CIPP [Cambridge International Primary

E

Program] thus enabling students to discover themselves. The school has been ranked amongst the top 30 International schools in India. The school also has a high academic standard. The faculty believes learning to be a process in which each student discovers and constructs meaning from information and experience. "Teachers at Excelsior teach more for understanding than just from the examination point of view. The classrooms are more experiential and collaborative so that every child learns deeply and meaningfully as we need to prepare children more for skills which they will use in their lives", says Mrs. Nambiar.

t is evening time and eight years old Neha's mother Kirin tries to divert her wandering attention back to the books. "Read it carefully Neha. Put it down and then cram it!" Neha suddenly nods then in a sing -song manner mugs her lessons. This grim picture may be being played out in many households. Little Neha may just be one of the many students beginning to formulate an opinion that studies is the most boring activity! FUN AND GAMES? What exactly is fun and games applied to studying? It is a straightforward system of teaching lessons through puzzles, mazes, tricky observation games and drawing and colouring or even reconstructing the lesson through a pictorial blueprint. After reading a lesson the child looks forward to understanding the tutorial through this fashion. ByNitaMehta COME A LONG WAY... Change is always welcome!

competitive environment are phenomenal. Children are dragged into the "do well or else..." syndrome by constant reminders from all quarters. There is no fun aspects left for any framework construing study time. Slowly this thought is changing. Suggestions are being made to base teaching through a fun and games methods RESEARCH SAYS.... In fact a 2007 study by Carnegie Mellon University's Psychology Department reported that math games played by young students increased their basic math abilities! Dr Sayyara Ansari leading child psychologist and counselor says, "activity" based studies give all an round development to a child. The reason being that, because of the use of full mental powers it gives a freshness to the child's outlook towards studies." DrVikas Taneja, senior pediatrician and child development expert says, "in the formative years of a child teaching should be done through fun and games. It is at this age children are using all five senses to absorb everything around them leading to better wisdom. If we allow the child to learn through a gaming activity supported lesson he develops reasoning, logic and the basis of his main intellect. Parents today must understand that stress through studies is the biggest damaging factor towards children's development. Let us face it parents want to control everything their child does! May it be their studies or even free time! Dance lessons, tennis etc all controlled! What they do not realize is that they are taking away free will from the child!" PRACTICAL SENSE... Practical knowledge goes a long way in assuring understanding. Experts view that if teaching a child about a tiger instead of teaching him verbally let him also plunge into the world of paints, crayons, and actually colour a tiger! Allow him to know more about the tiger through this fun and games route! THE OPINION.... We took this question to our readers and many animatedly agreed with this! Teachers in schools are now further depending on teaching children through fun methods. "It makes them sit jp and pay attention." Say most early education teachers. Geeta Chadha, school teacher, feels it is absolutely necessary to involve fun in teaching methods through structured activities. Although she adds this should be done for only specific age groups since as the classes get higher so does the syllabus-and this requires the more conventional approach whilst imparting knowledge. Karuna Shriram, a special educator feels, "Lessons should be taught through fun and games method whatever the class is! This is a brilliant way of registering lessons!" she says. "Sadly I believe most schools do not apply these methods and end up loading the method of mugging and cramming on to the poor children!" Puja Bakshi mother of two says "I used fun and games in studies when I introduced my children initially into the world of school and knowledge. My children thankfully began to believe school is fun and not the torture as some children unfortunately begin to imagine. As the children moved on to higher classes it was easier to reach out to them with more serious stuff!" Mini Chibber, a grandmother, now hunts only book shops to buy presents for her grand children. "They only want activity books. My daughter is happy since she feels that keeps them completely busy for some part of the day!" PREACH THE RIGHT WAY.... World over educators, government and even parents are debating on the best ways to Educate children, not only providing knowledge and information but also values and wisdom. HELP IS NEAR There are many publication houses who have committed themselves to publishing books that come with the motto 'books that enrich the mind". The array of titles range from non -fiction mythology stories, history stories and even fiction tales. Efforts are being made to introduce activity books that contain topical subjects included in school lessons. When my children were growing, I felt we needed books on tough topics made easy. Drawing from the well of our varied cultures the idea of making well researched, simple, colorful books on mythology came about. This is a win-win situation for both parents and children as the parents

want children to gain this knowledge and because of the presentation, the children themselves pick up the books. Today I clearly see how important it is to make study time fun. Children have so many distractions. School, studying etc, falls on the wrong side of the line that demarcates interesting from boring! Take my grandson Aarav, I quite believe that teaching him his math lessons through a gaming process has actually helped him in doing mental math! Anurag Mehta, my son told me, "In my school years I learned through repeat and learn method! Also interesting books came with saintly messages or in your face moral tutoring! Even going to the book stores and picking up books meant thickly laced preachy books without any fun aspects! He feels "books should not only entertain children with their interesting narration and vivid illustrations but also inculcate practical wisdom and values in children to help them face day to day challenges of life! Even saying that sounds like we are presenting a lecturethe child today has awareness that is mind boggling!" On a more serious note, when listing themes for children's books, we always insist that make it brain involving interesting! We are now redoing our books into activity books. Our subjects are actually quite school book. The idea now is to

graduate to reading levels where the child has risen one rung higher from reading to understanding what he is reading! Activities like puzzles, games etc assure that!" Having said that, we have over these years realized that in India parents choose what their children should be reading. Especially the younger ones! Parents are conscious that idle reading is fine but some reading should educate the child along the way too. Our education systems demand academic brilliance and just by wishing it away it will not go away! Parents as I said with this in mind choose books that have some value with the children's ongoing school syllabus. Also most parents want to culturally enrich their off springs and look for such themes whilst book shopping. Nothing wrong with that! However as a publisher for children's books it is very important to present a child friendly book too! We at the publication after much market research touch on topics that parents will definitely pick-yet we also make sure it is extremely child friendly too! VISION TO TEXT Illustrations play a very major role in creating interest in children. Critics sometimes scoff at vivid illustrations calling them loud and garish. However

it is very important for children to connect visually to whatever they read. These should be applied to activity books as well. Story telling is an art that is changing its face with the times. Even read aloud stories have something unusual to offer, though the topics are common. The element of adding fun and grip into old plots make them interesting reads. More than anything, emerging interest in reading is known to come from a child reading a book with the help of an adult! So you see, bonding time as well as nurturing a reading habit develops by something as uncomplicated and as appealing as a read aloud story session! IN THE END.... The ditty 'rain, rain go away little Johnny wants to play1 can be altered to, 'study study go away little Johnny wants to play!1 In today's world, with all the stress and pressures heaped on our hapless growing youth, this just could be the new jingle. But all is not lost! The binding ropes of studies that anchor students to classrooms can change just by adding fun and games into the method of teaching lessons that are so important to learn and more than anything remember!

DINESH PATIDAR CMD

I CREATE SOMETHING NEW
When the present CMD, Dinesh Patidar of Shakti Pumps (I) Ltd.joined the company in 1987, he had a dream of taking the company to the pinnacle of success. But he didn't know how to convert his dream into reality and how to go about to achieve this goal. He had even no idea that what were the challenges in the store waiting for him on his way. Despite ail he was determined and headstrong. Just one thing was very clear to his - "I will not stop, I will not go back and I will never lose/' He kept continuing his journey and finally after 25 years he proved himself as a successful self made businessmen and a visionary. Now, when he bob back, everything seems like a dream: "How it was difficult to fulfill his dream which was next to impossible". But, his hard work and dedication of rainbow and took him to newer of Excerpts from his astonishing journey:
Tell us something about your childhood. Where were you born and brought up? I was born in commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh. Since childhood I was more inclined towards business than studies. As my father was a businessman so I got an opportunity to understand the intricacies of business at an early age. Where did you get your education? I completed my schooling from Indore itself, and then moved to college for graduation but due to keen interest in business I decided to put extra hours to work which deprived me of enough time for study. In order to balance study and work I joined evening classes. I used to work for whole day in office extending full support to father in business. It was really tough time for me, but I accepted as a challenge and did my best. When and how your company Shakti Pumps started? My father, Shri. Manoharlal Ji Patidar started Shakti Pumps from a scratch way back in 1982 with a meager capital supported by bank finance. When did you join the company and how was your initial experience? I joined the company in 1987 with an intention to extend a helping hand to my father in the business. Like any other beginner, I also had to face a lot of problems and challenges. It was the time of license/quota raj where government controls were very strict. Doing business was not easy also due to inadequate capital support. But I didn't lose patience. More the troubles came on the way, more courage I gained and fought back. My will power and energy level was always higher than the difficulties I faced. My willpower and energy level came out always stronger than my prevailing difficulties. What was the biggest challenge in front of you when you joined the company? The biggest challenge was to create a talent pool with right people to leverage skills and talents to accomplish the tasks. I realized that forming a core team of professionals was not easy as you may think. I put all efforts to form a core team of reliable and hard working professionals and fostered an environment of team work. Now you have reached the height of success. How do you feel about your journey so far? In every business every day and every moment brings new challenges and opportunities. Unfortunately I had to face more challenges than opportunities. We did not have skilled workers and resources were limited too. Lack of technology support was another weakness. In those days, for even making a phone call AnimPZlCTn

from Pithampur to Indore, we had to book trunk calls. Farmers were not brand conscious and not aware of the quality and brand value and therefore selling a branded pump was tough especially at a time when the purchasing power of farmers was very poor. Now it gives us immense satisfaction that we have gone a long way dealing with all odds. Now we have 800+ employees with sprawling manufacturing facilities for various models of pumps and motors for diverse applications. Government rules and regulations were also a hurdle? In those days, the government permission was required to supply pumps for whatever sort of purposes and to get that permission was not very easy. It was not at all a practical idea and created lots of problems. The whole process was so slow that it took a long time to invent a new way and to do more innovative experiments with it. Any memorable experience which you would like to share with our readers? Yes, I do remember an incident. We were expanding our business and we had just started export of our products abroad. Exporting our products abroad was a matter of pride that time. One day a customer of Middle East landed at Indore Airport looking for our office. He reached the airport and asked for our address. A taxi driver from the airport called up and said there was a foreigner who was asking for our company's address. I am proud to state it was really a huge opportunity which has not only helped us to expand our export business, but also boosted our confidence level. After

that we achieved tremendous growth in export also. Who were your closest companions and dedicated workers in this journey of success? Only a good team of honest, hard working and dedicated workers can run a successful business enterprise. Whosoever was a part of this journey, directly or indirectly, has played a significant and admirable role in the success of our company. All of

them have been an important asset to the company. Among them, a couple of names deserved to be mentioned are Mr. B.R. Patidar and Mr. Ramesh Patidar. They remained so close to the company and are still part of the core management team. What is your policy for the employees and how do you make them work together as a team? I have built up relationship of trust with my

employees. I never behaves like a boss. Instead I am like a friend, a mentor and a colleague. I always appreciate them for their good work and never criticize on any of their mistakes. I urge them to learn from those mistakes. To make people work together and love their work place it's an essential thing to make the environment pleasant and happy. I do all possible efforts to assure this. I recognize every effort of my employees. I believe that every employee should get equal opportunity to participate in his/her respective area. I motivate them to maintain their physical, mental and intellectual health. I also try to do justice in terms their remuneration and rewards. Whom do you want to give the credit of your success? All the credit of my success goes to my employees. The company has reached to the height of success because of their dedication and hard work. They have only made it possible. What are fundamental elements to run a successful company? First of all, you should be a visionary. You should have a big dream in your heart. Then you should have a good team of honest, hard working and dedicated workers who can execute your decisions on the right time. Latest and modern technology is also an essential ingredient to develop a success and sustainable engineering product. Besides all these things, you should have enough courage and a positive approach that you will win.

· At a very early age and with very limited resources you started this company. What was the inspiration behind? After completing my school education from Rajasta I did my graduation from City College, Kolkata. Then I took admission in Law simultaneously started helping my father in his business. My father has a small hosiery business. At that time hosiery industry was not very developed. Most of the brands were local and their quality was also not very good. I always wanted to do something new and different. So in 1957 with a business partner I started a manufacturing and trading company by the name of Binod Hosiery. It was my father's suggestion. Then while working, we realized that just manufacturing the good quality products was not enough. We need a brand name. Then we started this brand name - Rupa. After sometime as the business started growing, two of my brothers also joined the business. From that day we are working hard to build up this empire. All of have given our heart and soul to it. Precisely this journey must have not been easy. What were the challenges? What problems did you face in this process? The biggest challenge and problem on the way of any business, is to first of all prove your calibre. No one entertains and give chance to the newcomers easily. So the biggest challenge in front of us was to prove ourselves. Distributors were not ready to talk to us. Initial years were

full of difficulties. But we never gave up and eventually proved that our hard work and dedication were not a waste. After experiencing our work and product quality no one could say us- NO. After that journey towards success started and we never looked behind. At Initial stage we didn't have much money and resources. I myself used to travel to different cities to see and experience the market trends. I always used to travel in a general class. To stay in general ordinary hotels was the routine part of my life at that time. Many times I used to get fresh at the station only. That' was a challenging time. But for me my business was everything and for that I was ready to suffer up to any extend. Problems were negligible in front of my ambition. Was your business limited to Kolkata in early years? When did you started marketing all over the country? Yes, we had started from Kolkata. Kolkata's feedback was very good. Then we started expanding our business. First destinations were Bihar and UP Marketing and branding is the key of your company. How important do you think branding is for the success of any company? Branding is the key of a business. The good and reliable quality of the products is of course very important. But with the quality one should also focus on establishing the product as a big brand. Aishwarya Rai, Govinda, Saif All Khan, Sanjay Dutt and Hritik Roshan have been appeared in our advertisement. Rupa has many different products such as Frontline, Softline, Macroman series etc. All these are brands in itself. Big film stars have done your advertisement. Do you have any specific policy regarding advertisement? We do not have any policy as such. But advertisement and promotion are very important for any company. Advertisement and promotion played a very important and significant role in the success of our company. In 80s and 90s we were one of initial brands who took top models and film stars for promotion and advertisement. In 1990 Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai did the advertisement of Rupa Softline and in the Year 1999 Govinda was the brand ambassador of Rupa company. Celina Jately and Koina Mitra had done our advertisement. We believe that the brand ambassador of a hosiery product should be a person who is very popular among masses who has reach to the large number of people. Now Rupa has become a public limited company. What are the changes that have taken place? Precisely many things have changed. Now whoever invested in our company becomes automatically a partner in the company and its our responsibly to take care of our investors and partners. We have decided to give 150 percent dividend return to our investors. Investors are the part of the company. We are with them in their good and bad times. But for our consumers nothing has changed. We are still a brand for them, making good quality products and taking care of their requirements. Consumers are very important for us. They trust on our quality products and in future we will try our best to enhance the quality. Globalization has opened a huge market. Not there are immense possibilities but at the same time the competition and challenges have

also become tough. What are your policies to fight in this hard competitive market? The growth of market and competition is same in the globalized world. But the door of opportunities is always open for them who work with honesty and dedication. We have established ourselves as a high quality product in the market. We have won the trust of our consumers. I believe that till the time we are working honestly, we will survive and grow, n Rupa Company not only did the business, earned profit but also returned it to the society. Tell us something about your corporate social responsibility? We take everything from the society. So it's our responsibility to return it to the society on a larger scale from where we have got it. As a corporate company and as a citizen of this country we have fundamental responsibilities. We have always fulfilled those responsibilities. In this process we have started a college in Rajasthan. The name of the college is Shobhasaria Engineering College. Apart from this college we are also attached to the Heritage Institute of Technology, the heritage school and Shri Shri Academy in Kolkata. We have always tried to do our best in social services. We are also working with Shankar Netralay and Eye Hospital in Kolkata. i What was the reason behind opening an engineering college? We opened an engineering college because only with education we can reach to the heights of success. Only then we can enter in new decade and only with the power of knowledge and education we can become the world power. There was a well thought idea behind starting an engineering college. The most we need today is education and especially the technical education. Technology plays a very important role in the success of any country. We want that large number of young population of our country can get access to the education. Good technical education should be available to everybody. We have the dream where every young person of this country would have access to good technical education. It's a small start. Now gradually the responsibilities of the company is shifting to the second generation. But now at this age also you seem to be so active, healthy and happy. You still travel a lot, roam around the world and take big responsibilities in the company. What's the secret of your success? I believe in myself. It was my belief only who took me from scratch to this height of success. I always had this trust that one day we will reach to this point. We will win the hearts of our consumers. One day we will be a big brand. We worked day and night. We saw good times and bad times. In bad times we never lost the hope. We continued our journey with this very belief inside that yes we can. We can ignore the dedication and hard work of each and every employee of this company. Everybody has given their heart and soul. Their dedication still inspires me to continue this journey. i What's the key of success? Vision and hard work. You really need to be honest towards your work and your product. Vision plays a very important role in the success of any company. Many people are hard worker, but in absence of vision you cannot see after a certain point.

Soon he started expanding operations and in the year 1986 introduced branded mustard oil by the name of 'Bail Kolhu'. In 1999, the family business was c o n v e r t e d into a proper

organization and a company called BL Agro Oils Ltd. came into existence ('BL'being initials of Ghanshyam Khandelwal's father Bishan Lai). Since then, Ghanshyam Khandelwal, Managing Director of BL Agro Oils Ltd. has led a tremendous story of growth and success extracted strenuously from the seeds of passion, devotion and business ethics. "From the very beginning we have followed a simple business philosophy - to offer the purest possible edible oil to the consumer" says Khandelwal.

"The past years have witnessed many changes in our society, in people's living patterns and eating habits. We also have changed consistently with the changing times but our core philosophy still remains the same and that is to never compromise with the purity and overall quality of our oils." he adds. It seems that this philosophy has resulted into enormous trust, faith and brand value for BL Agro's products. It is a widely known fact in the industry that since its introduction, thousands of samples of Bail Kolhu Mustard

Oil have been lifted and inspected by the regulatory authorities, but not even a single sample has failed their tests. This is a real achievement for any edible oil

Today as one of North India's leading edible oil companies, BL Agro is engaged in Refining, Quality Control, Packaging and Marketing of many popular mustard, refined and other edible oil brands. Chronologically studying the journey of BL Agro, it is very evident that the company has operated dynamically throughout its life. The management seems to have farsighted the opportunities and invested consistently in capacity building and technological up-gradations. This strategy is working good for the company as is clear from the fact that in the course of just 14

years, BL Agro has enhanced its packing capacity to an astonishing 150 times. From a single room manual packaging unit in 1998 (situated in Madhobari area in Bareilly city) having a capacity of 5 TPD (Tonne per Day), the company grew to establish a state-of the-art s e m i - a u t o m a t i c p l a n t in Parsakhera industrial area on the outskirts of Bareilly. In 2005 this plant was commissioned with a capacity of 100 TPD which has since been enhanced to a whooping 750 TPD today. Spread on a sprawling 10000 sq. mtrs., the new plant also enabled BL Agro to set up its own refinery operations. The refining capacity that was just 50 TPD in 2005 grew to 150 TPD by 2009 and then to 300 TPD by 2012. For producing

To stick steadfast on its core philosophy of maintaining highest quality standards, BL Agro had established a state-ofthe-art Quality Control laboratory facility way back in 1998. Currently this laboratory is one of the largest and best-equipped in the entire country. Similarly the packing unit at BL Agro is one of the largest in India and the largest in UP with 750 tonne/day/shift capacity. Another major factor responsible for BL Agro's unparalleled growth is the fact that the multifold increase in production capacities was consistently matched by the increasing product demands - a fact that has been made possible by introducing aggressive distribution strategies and innovative marketing techniques.

The warehousing facilities of BL Agro are located next to an operational railway siding that is also used for transportation of company goods. The warehouse had a capacity of 6000 Tonnes in 2011.
