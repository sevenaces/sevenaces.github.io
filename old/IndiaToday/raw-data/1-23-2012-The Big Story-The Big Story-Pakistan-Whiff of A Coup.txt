Pakistan's government is on the brink. Its first coup in over a decade now seems imminent.
Special Forces assault on Abbottabad that caused the death of America's most wanted man, Osama bin Laden. The audacious raid caused a public loss of face for the Pakistan Army. It triggered fears of an imminent coup. Within a week of the raid, say Pakistani military officials, Pakistan's then ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani was in touch with US-based businessman Mansoor Ijaz to hand a memo to the Pentagon, allegedly at the behest of Zardari. The memo, whose contents were publicised by Ijaz, asked the US to rein in Pakistan's powerful generals and prevent a coup. In return, the civilian government assured disbanding of the ISI's `S' branch that was tasked with

and Sandeep Unnithan n January 11, Pakistan's powerful army unsheathed a sword it has dangled over every civilian government since Pakistan's first coup in 1958. A press release from the army's Directorate General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) warned that "critical comments" made by Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to a Chinese newspaper would have "serious ramifications" and could wreak "potentially grievous consequences for the country". It was the strongest de-

O

nouncement yet of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)-led Government. Within an hour of the army statement, Gilani sacked defence secretary Lt-General (retired) Naeem Khalid Lodhi. Gilani accused Lodhi, an acolyte of General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, of creating a misunderstanding between state institutions, including the Prime Minister's Secretariat and the army. Analysts say the defence secretary was a bridge between the generals and the civilian Government. His dismissal could lead to a widening of the civil-military gulf, hastening a coup. Such fears are not unfounded. The army has overthrown the civilian government in three coups: in 1958, 1977 and 1999.

Dictators have ruled the country for more than half of its post-independence history. The army is the chief arbiter of power, controlling all essential levers, including foreign policy. But since president Pervez Musharraf was forced out of power in 2008, the army under General Kayani has largely stayed in the barracks. Gilani termed the army's action illegal and unconstitutional but did nothing. Journalists from across the world flocked to Islamabad to cover yet another potential coup. What has caused the army to turn on President Asif Ali Zardari after giving him three years of uninterrupted power? The fracture can be traced to the May 2, 2011 US

destabilising Afghanistan and imposing safeguards on the country's nuclear weapons programme. Memogate marked a new low between Pakistan's twin power centres-- General Headquarters Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The military regarded the contents of the memo as treasonous. On December 6, President Zardari reportedly suffered a minor heart attack and flew to Dubai for treatment. The heart attack story has since been questioned. Aides now say President Zardari was under severe mental stress after Memogate. Zardari's return was as surprising as his departure. He came home on December 18, after a lengthy meeting between Gilani and General Kayani. Officially, it was stated that Gilani facilitated a brief conversation between the President and the army chief. But army officials played down the telephone talk, terming it "a chance conversation" during which the army chief only inquired about the President's health. Since then, the Government has publicly tried to assert control over the military. On December 27, 2011, Gilani said, "Nobody can say that he is not under the Government." On January 6, at a function at the National Defence University, Islamabad, Gilani once again asserted that "the military should remain subservient to civilian rule. All national institutions should perform their functions in their respective domains." General Kayani was in the audience. The General's reaction is not known, but the Prime Minister's statements were unlikely to have thrilled him. A day later, Gilani warned that conspiracies were being hatched to "pack up" his Government. General Kayani is responding in kind. On January 11, he called for a

meeting of the corps commanders, the army's equivalent of a cabinet meeting. He also announced he was replacing the head of the Islamabad-based 111 Brigade with another officer. The transfer at the `coup brigade'--it has toppled the civilian government in all of Pakistan's three military takeovers-- was the clearest signal that General Kayani meant business. In the space of 24 hours, Pakistan's civilian government found itself caught in a pincer between two of the country's strongest institutions. On January 10, the Supreme Court had accused Gilani of not being an "honourable man" for his refusal to ask Swiss authorities to reopen money laundering cases against Zardari. The cases against Zardari were closed under the controversial National Reconciliation Ordinance of 2007, which benefited over 8,000 people, including politicians and bureaucrats. Since it annulled the amnesty in 2009, the apex court has been pressuring the Government to reopen cases against Zardari. A five-judge bench referred the case to Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry who is to hear the case on January 16. The bench listed six options including removing Gilani from office and initiating action against him for contempt of court and showing loyalty to his party rather than the Constitution. Even as the courts move in on Gilani and Zardari, there is the threat from the military. A Gilani aide told INDIA TODAY late on January 11 that the army statement had stunned both the Prime Minister and the President. "The rapid moves have set off alarm bells," he said. The army was upset with Gilani's interview to China's People's Daily Online where he termed "unconstitutional and illegal" the responses by General Kayani and DG ISI Lt-General Shuja Pasha to the Supreme Court. The interview was

seen as a calculated snub to General Kayani who had returned from a week-long official tour of Beijing. Gilani implied Kayani and Pasha had bypassed the Government in deposing before the court on December 21 and suggesting that Memogate was a conspiracy against the army. The DG ISPR army said they appeared only after being named respondents in the Memogate scandal. In October 2011, Mansoor Ijaz accused Haqqani of passing a memo to Admiral Mike Mullen, then US chief of defence staff. The memo expressed fears of a military takeover by the Pakistan Army. The fears were heightened after the May 2 raid by US special forces which killed bin Laden. A commission of inquiry set up by the Supreme Court on December 30 is investigating the secret memo. Haqqani, who was sacked as ambassador, is one of the in the Pakistan media. Gilani also took credit for giving a three-year extension to the army chief in 2010. But so bitter is the fallout between the civilian establishment and the army that the first US drone strike in North Waziristan, after nearly two-month pause, went unnoticed. Drone strikes were suspended after a November 26, 2011 cross-border raid by NATO helicopter gunships killed 24 Pakistani soldiers and led to acrimony between US and Pakistan. Analysts, however, feel the current confrontation with the army has been manufactured by the civilian government. Ruling out the possibility of a coup, defence analyst Shireen M. Mazari justified the army's reaction. "The civilian government has deliberately dragged the army into a fight to escape the real issues. The Government should have imple-

respondents. Kayani and Pasha, who have testified to the authenticity of the memo, are also respondents. It's a cat and mouse game with both the civilian goverment and the Pakistan army trying to become the cat saving the nation from a rabid mouse. In public, the usually reticent General Kayani has reaffirmed the army's support for democracy. "There is no threat to democracy. The army will not take over," he said, speaking to soldiers at the Afghan border in December. He said speculation about a military takeover was "misleading" and was being used as a "bogey" to divert attention from "real issues". Gilani acted swiftly to assuage any hurt. He termed as absurd reports of the dismissal of Kayani and Pasha. "I am happy with him (Kayani)," he was quoted as saying mented the court verdict but has ignited a fight with the army for sympathy ahead of the general elections," Mazari said. The PPP's political opponents blame the Government for triggering a confrontation with the military. "My party stands with the Supreme Court," Tehreek-e-Insaf chief Imran Khan said, urging the Government to implement the court's verdict. The statements of both the army chief and DG ISI did not violate the Constitution, Imran emphasised and ruled out the chance of a coup even in the distant future. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Chairman Nawaz Sharif said Gilani and Zardari had rejected Supreme Court verdicts and thrown the country into fresh turmoil. Clearly, the Pakistan Army too is choosing to think this way. I
