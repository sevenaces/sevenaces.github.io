Once booming sectors have cut back on hiring. With recession abroad and policy paralysis at home, young job seekers will find it difficult to get employment.
By Dhiraj Nayyar and Shravya Jain

he economic slowdown is no longer a mere conversational statistic. It is now hitting the middle class where it hurts most: In jobs. Two surveys, conducted by apex industry chambers FICCI and ASSOCHAM, released in the first week of September, confirm what head hunters and job portals have noticed for months: India Inc's pessimism about its business prospects, evident now for more than a year, has finally translated into a cut in hiring. Between April and June 2012, the prospects of finding a job across a range of the most employment-intensive sectors--like information technology (IT), financial services, telecom and hospitality--in the economy fell dramatically compared with the first three months of 2012. With recession abroad, and policy paralysis at home, the nightmare for young job seekers looks unlikely to end. The ASSOCHAM survey indicates where jobs will be lost, both in industry and geographical terms. Overall, in the 32

T

sectors surveyed, there is a 20 per cent drop in hiring between April and June when compared with January to March.  The biggest decline is in IT services, the largest white collar employer, where hiring fell by 31 per cent.  The next biggest decline is in retail: New recruitment fell by 29.8 per cent.  Hiring in hospitality--restaurants and hotels--fell 29.2 per cent.  In infrastructure sectors--power, roads, ports, airports, which are caught in several Government-induced bottlenecks, hiring fell by 24.9 per cent.  In the crisis-ridden telecom sector, employment fell by 23.4 per cent. The most startling finding of FICCI's business confidence survey for the three-month period between April and

June 2012 is on employment. For the first time since the quarterly survey was initiated in July-September 2010, of the 150 companies that were studied, a massive 84 per cent expected hiring to fall or remain static. FICCI's survey expects growth over the next six months to be "jobless". The fall in GDP growth to an average of just 5.4 per cent in the first six months of 2012 has cost jobs. There is a massive difference in the number of new jobs created at 5 per cent and 7 per cent, which was roughly the growth rate in 2011-12. That number is three million. Says economist Bibek Debroy, "At 7 per cent growth, the economy would create 10.5 million new jobs in a year. At 5 per cent growth, it will

be just 7.5 million." With industrial growth stagnant and agricultural growth suffering because of this year's erratic monsoon, the prospects for the remainder of 2012 look dismal. Even the services sector, the prime generator of jobs in India, is slowing down. It recorded just 6.9 per cent growth between April and June 2012, much lower than the 7.8 per cent that analysts had forecast. The costs are human. Take Varun Sharma, a 46-year-old from Delhi, formerly general manager of a 4-star hotel in Jodhpur with an annual salary of Rs 14 lakh. He lost his job in January and spent the next eight months looking for a new one. In July, he ended up launching a food and beverage consultancy

firm in Delhi but business is still slow. Sharma is not the only one struggling. In September 2011, it took Delhibased chartered accountant Dishant Gupta, 24, less than a week to get a job. He quit eight months later in April 2012. Since then, he has sent his resume to 20 companies to no avail. "Jobs seem to have dried up," he says. For India, a decline in growth rate from over 8 per cent in 2010-11 to just over 5 per cent in 2012-13 is like a move from 3 per cent growth to a recession in the West. "The sharp economic slowdown and weak performance in manufacturing will take a toll on job creation," says D.K. Joshi, chief economist at analytics firm Crisil. The UPA regime must take lion's share of the blame. Besieged by scams since late 2010, it has been in a state of frozen turbulence. Reformist legislation, in insurance, banking and retail, which could have lifted growth and employment, is stuck. The monsoon session of Parliament has been lost to the coal scam. In the prevailing environment, the jobs scenario may unfold differently for different sectors. IT is the one sector most dependent on how economic conditions overseas evolve. Others such as banking and finance, telecom and retail depend more on how domestic policy unfolds. With the Government living from scam to scam, things look bleak. of the middle class. In Infosys, many employees are simply sitting on the benches with no work. Infosys CEO S.D. Shibulal told a newspaper in August, "We are quite uncomfortable with this (benching of so many staff). It is not a strategy, but when we do not see that kind of growth we saw earlier and when revenues and topline are falling, people get benched." Infosys has, however, not changed its original plan of hiring 35,000 new people, with 13,000 for BPO operations alone, in this fiscal year. However, that figure is 22 per cent less than the number for 2011-12. Also, those hired for jobs may have to wait before they are absorbed. Infosys has announced that it would delay bringing on board nearly 28,000 engineers hired from campuses to as late as July 2013. Other firms are also deferring hiring. iGate has delayed fresher joining dates of around 1,000 engineers by three to six months. "Close to 1,000 freshers, who were expected to join in
THE SLOWDOWN IN THE US AND EUROPE HAS HIT THE IT SECTOR HARD

July-August, will now join by the end of September or October," says Srinivas Kandula, HR head at iGate. "If the economic situation worsens, we will have to delay it by another quarter," he adds. The IT industry's apex body, NASSCOM, expects the sector grow by 14-15 per cent in 2012-13, compared to 3040 per cent annual growth levels recorded in the mid-2000s during the global economic boom, and 18 per cent recorded in 2011-12. Independent analysts of the sector are less optimistic than the industry. The average projection by analysts for growth in IT services in 2012-13 is just 5-6 per cent. The fate of India's IT is closely tied to growth prospects in advanced economies. More than 60 per cent of the IT industry's revenues come from the US and Europe. Europe is still caught in a serious debt trap--growth is unlikely to be in positive territory for the next six months. The US is doing marginally better, growing at just over 1.5 per cent. But with presidential elections imminent, there is pressure on American companies to go slow on outsourcing.

The uncertain economic environment has also seen a fall in the usually high rate of loss of employees of IT companies. That has, in turn, meant that companies have to hire fewer people. "We have seen a decline in hiring demand but that is largely due to decrease in attrition of the company," says Nitin Bhat, vice-president and global hiring leader of business process management company Genpact. So far, incumbents are holding on to their jobs, but for new entrants to the job market, the possibilities are very limited.

FINANCIAL SECTOR
No banking on new hires
The financial sector-- banking, insurance and other financial services taken together--is the second largest white collar employer after IT services. The ASSOCHAM survey shows a decline in the hiring trend between the January to March quarter and the April to June quarter from over 20,000 jobs to over

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
White collar, no work
The IT sector is the biggest provider of white collar jobs by some distance. According to the Assocham survey, the sector generated more than 66,000 new hires between January and March 2012 and just over 46,000 between April and June 2012. The next biggest employer was academics--schools and universities are still a booming sector-- generating just under 9,000 jobs between January and March and just over 13,000 between April and June, only 15-25 per cent of the jobs created in IT. What happens to growth in IT is therefore crucial for the employment prospects of a very large section

17,000. The steepest decline of over 20 per cent is in the insurance segment. It is also the segment which the Government could boost with reformist legislation, but has made little progress in doing so. The financial sector bore the brunt of the global economic crisis between October 2008 and March 2009. That period was the first time post-liberalisation that white collar workers were laid off in large numbers as banks and insurance companies, particularly those with foreign equity and those in the private sector, were squeezed. The scenario for 2012-13 may not be as dire as in 2008-09, but it isn't even half as good as in the post-crisis year of 2009-10 when the sector grew by 31.6 per cent. A forecast by Kotak Institutional Equities says the sector is expected to grow 14-15 per cent in 2012-13. Foreign banks have already begun adjusting their workforce. Citigroup cut 100 jobs in its India operations in January. HSBC has asked 300 people to leave in the past few months. Indian banks were relatively immune from the global financial crisis of 2008. In 2012-13, they are more vulnerable because of a significant rise in nonperforming assets. A slowdown in economic growth coupled with high interest rates is a nightmare scenario for repayment of loans. The infrastructure sector, particularly coal and power, could cause serious problems for banks. Several projects are held up because of environmental problems and problems in the supply of inputs like gas and coal. The probability of default on debt is high. Drawing a parallel with the US banking crisis of 2008, a senior industry representative says "the power sector could be the subprime crisis of India". In a gloomy scenario, it is tough to find a job. Mohit Gulyani, a 35-year-old banking professional in Mumbai, regrets the day he left a stable job in a global research agency for a brokerage firm in December 2011. He had been at the brokerage for barely three months when the company shut down in February 2012. "I have so many years of experience but I couldn't find a job!" After four months he settled for a relatively junior job in a foreign bank.

"I had taken a car loan in January and my wife is a homemaker. I really had no choice," he says. Gulyani is not the only one who is settling for jobs they are overqualified for. There are reports of people dressing down their CVs so that they do not appear overqualified for jobs that are available. Gulyani's advice for those who have a job is simple: "Right now, it is best to stay where you are." That would be of little solace to those desperate to switch. The Government could help boost the financial sector. A long pending bill to raise the FDI limit in insurance from 26 per cent to 49 per cent would give a fillip to the sub-sector of financial services which is showing the greatest decline in employment prospects. However, with Parliament stalled and Government in paralysis, the light for reform is very dim.

LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL EXPERTS SAY HIRING WON'T START ANYTIME SOON

Sentiment on hiring is definitely poor across different sectors.Most vulnerable are insurance and telecom,because of regulatory issues. Vikram Bakshi
MD, MCDONALD'S

TELECOM
Sunrise sector, it's time for sunset
Three years ago, telecom was one of the sunrise sectors of the Indian economy, providing cheap communications access to hundreds of millions of Indians and attractive employment opportunities to thousands of others. An inept Government, which allowed the 2G spectrum scam, and an over zealous regulator, whose recommendations of exorbitant auction reserve prices will send firms into serious debt problems, have applied the brakes on the sector. The ultimate sufferer is the average middle class person looking for a job. Hiring in the telecom sector shrunk by 60-70 per cent in the first two quarters of this year compared with last year, according to recruitment firm GlobalHunt. According to the ASSOCHAM survey, there has been a 23 per cent fall in the first quarter of 2012-13 when compared with the last quarter of 2011-12. "The industry is no longer hiring in large numbers. It has been happening in the last nine months or so and I believe the trend will continue," says Ashok Ramchandran, HR director of Vodafone.

scam and the cancellation of licences by the Supreme Court. Telenor has announced that it is cutting 2,000 jobs in its joint venture with Uninor. If Uninor fails to win a licence in the new auctions for the cancelled licences, its entire workforce of 17,500 could be laid off. The aftermath of the 2G scam is not the only problem facing the sector. Brutal competition has reduced margins in the voice telephony space. Value-added services in 3G have not picked up. Sources in the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) say that 3G penetration is no more than 6 per cent of total cellphone users. Revenue streams are therefore struggling. On the other hand, costs are rising. TRAI's May 2012 recommendations for the auction of the 122 cancelled licences have set a high base price of Rs 14,000 crore. The price set at this auction will determine the price that telecom companies will have to pay for spectrum they already hold, which they received cheaply in the 1990s. That will raise the debt burden and the burden of paying interest at very high rates. By TRAI's own estimate, the telecom industry in India as a whole will record losses in 2012-13 and 2013-14, the next two financial years. A turnaround to positive profit is expected only in 2014-15. The next few months will be worse than the last six as the new auctions take place and TRAI begins to reprice old spectrum.

The telecom industry is no longer recruiting in large numbers as before.This has been happening since the last nine months or so.I believe the trend will continue.

RETAIL
No expansion, no consolidation
The general slowdown in the Indian economy will, unsurprisingly, take a toll on retail as people spend less and save more in anticipation of a protracted slow growth. Major organised retail chains like Pantaloons, Shoppers Stop and Lifestyle are dealing with high debt and lower revenues by rationalising manpower. Even McDonald's is not immune. The fast food giant has cut its regular and breakfast menu prices by 6-10 per cent in north and east India starting August 1. The growth in sales at comparable outlets has

dropped to high single digits in AprilJune from double-digit growth last year in 2011-12. "Most of the organisations are focused on reducing costs and protecting their markets than on hiring or expanding," says Vikram Bakshi, managing director, McDonald's India. The organised sector is expected to grow by 25-30 per cent in 2012-13, only marginally lower than in 2011-12. Unorganised retail will grow by only 56 per cent this fiscal year. "The retail sector is definitely more cautious than it was two years ago. There is lack of expansion and consolidation," says Rachna Nath of consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. The situation could have been different had the Government managed to push through FDI in retail. The arrival of foreign retail chains like Walmart, Tesco and Carrefour and the setting up of supermarkets would have generated thousands of white collar sales jobs.

However, it botched its attempt to introduce the measure in November 2011 when a key ally, Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress, objected to the proposal. Later, another key ally, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, also expressed reservations. It seems unlikely that FDI in retail will be introduced in the tenure of this Government. Thousands of potential white collar jobs which would have been generated are now lost.

t has taken almost a year for India Inc to let its pessimism translate into fewer jobs. But with prospects bleak for the remainder of UPA term in office, reality has taken a firm hold. According to Naukri.com's latest bi-yearly outlook survey on hiring, fewer recruiters expect new jobs to be created this year while more foresee a possibility of job cuts. More

than half expect replacement hiring to be the trend while 5 per cent recruiters are expecting lay-offs. "The economy is slowing down and that will have an impact on hiring. Companies are being extremely cautious in hiring. Most vulnerable are insurance and telecom, especially because of their regulatory issues. Sentiment on hiring is definitely poor," says Sanjeev Bikhchandani, the founder of Naukri.com. That downbeat sentiment is likely to last for the rest of the financial year, until March 2013, given that the probability of an impressive recovery either in the global economy or in the Indian economy is very small. The children of liberalisation, born in 1991, and set to enter the job market in 2012, will bear the brunt of an economic miracle that has just got a reality check. It may be a while before the job market boom returns.
