Turns out that John Abraham, 39, can do more than just beef up for his own films. He intends to help others tone up as well, with his own chain of fitness centres, JA Fitness. His first beneficiaries ABRAHAM would be those buying homes at the luxurious residential Trump Towers, coming up in Pune. Following the success of Vicky Donor, Abraham has also taken on more films as a producer. Together with his entrepreneurial plans, he may not have the time to go about flashing his butt anymore.

Fashion cannot do without borrowing some glamour from film stars, apparent at the PCJ Delhi Couture Week held at Hotel Taj Palace from August 8 to 12

Designers Ashima-Leena cannot get enough of Sharmila Tagore. They sent her down the ramp as their trump card at couture week last year, and repeated her again. Going by how happy the orange sari and jacket made Sharmila, we won't ask why. But did she also pick something for the Saif-Kareena wedding?

Madhuri Dixit became
Devdas' Chandramukhi all over again, as showstopper for designer Anju Modi. She even mouthed lines from Tagore's poems and walked in tune with Amitabh Bachchan's rendition of Ekla Cholo Re. All very dramatic and one of her better sightings in recent times. Praise the Lord.

Sridevi has caught the fancy of designer Sabyasachi after he styled her look in Gauri Shinde's English Vinglish. So much so that he didn't want to wait till the end to send her down the ramp. Instead, she kickstarted the show and accompanied him on the runway at the onset. If that isn't a new muse, what is?

BACK TO BUSINESS
Long before Hazel Keech came along, another British model, Hazel Crowney, 27, was already entertaining us with item numbers. She is at it again, romancing Ravi Kishan in Jeena Hai Toh Thok Daal. Manish Vatsalya's Bihar-based gangster film ends Crowney's two-year break. She did her first full-fledged role in Mera Pehla Pehla Pyaar in 2007, but her film journey was cut short when Mumbai politician Raj Thackeray decided to rid the film industry of foreign actors, saying they were stealing local jobs. She must really like it here to have come back.

It's after midnight in India now, so Happy Independence Day from New York! Saleem Sinai would be 65...and gets to be in a movie at last! --Salman Rushdie

FEISTY PRANKSTER
Sumona Chakravarti, 24, the feisty Natasha of the TV series Bade Achhe Lagte Hain, has an ace up her sleeve. She has managed a spot in Anurag Basu's Barfi!, releasing on September 14, as Ileana D'Cruz's friend. She isn't new to films though, having worked as a child actor in Mann and Vidyarthi. But nothing half as exciting as playing silly tricks on Ranbir Kapoor's character in the film.

LITTLE CHAMP
Of all the tiny tots dancing their hearts out on Dance India Dance Li'l Masters Season 2, 13-year-old Faisal Khan has emerged the winner. The son of an autorickshaw driver in Mumbai, he is a Class VIII student at Meera's Academy in the city. Khan also has clear plans for the Rs 10 lakh prize money."I intend to buy my dad a new autorickshaw so that he does not ride one on lease any longer. My parents have supported me despite all odds and I will do anything to look after their needs with my abilities." Aww.

CAUGHT ON CAMERA
Composer Anirudh Ravichander, 22, is making music of a different kind. Pictures of his liplock with Tamil singer-actor Andrea Jeremiah, RAVICHANDER 27, are going viral on social AND JEREMIAH networking sites, almost as quickly as Kolaveri Di did earlier this year, in March. He has been roped in to score music for Bejoy Nambiar's David, but Jeremiah is far ahead, with several acting and singing credits to her name. Doesn't look like disparate fame will keep them apart.

PACKING A PUNCH
Very few can get away with punching Salman Khan. Gavie Chahal, 31, does, during a fight scene in Ek Tha Tiger, where he plays an ISI agent. His Bollywood debut has come after a long wait. He came to Mumbai in 2005 and started acting in television serials, most notably as Shivendu Kaushik in Mrs Kaushik Ki Paanch Bahuein on Zee TV."Now I'm open to good work in Bollywood," he says.

QUEEN BEES TAKE A BOW

Tiny cholis aren't new to Katrina Kaif, but she teamed it with an over-thetop heavy gold bridal lehenga, as the showstopper for Manish Malhotra. Good thing she has been training to get tougher. With Ek Tha Tiger taking off so well, a lehenga shouldn't wear her down.

Reality Overdose VJ Pooja Misrra wanted to auction her Bigg Boss 5 oufits. Thankfully, the plan was shelved before it took off. Who would even want those? Royal Touch Queen of Bhutan Jetsun Pema was designer Manav Gangwani's guest of honour, and sat in the front row in a black gown. Show Piece Actor Alia Bhatt was on Karan Johar's arm in a tiny frock. She went all out to preen for the cameras.
