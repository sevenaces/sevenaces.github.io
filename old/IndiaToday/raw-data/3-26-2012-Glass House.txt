STAR PASS
ressed in white kurta, jeans and giant dark glasses, actor Rakhi Sawant created a stir in Parliament on March 12."Main Soniaji ki bahut respect karti hoon. I am sure she will bring a Budget for the aam aadmi," she gushed. But the mystery was who had invited her. It turns out her pass was sanctioned by Syed Azeez Pasha, a CPI MP from Andhra Pradesh, whose term in Rajya Sabha ends in March. He claims he was deceived and blames a Congressman."I gave two passes to Shakeel Saifi, an associate of the Delhi PWD Minister R.K. Chauhan. I didn't know who it was for," says Pasha. Saifi, chairman of the Akhil Bharatiya Muslim Yuva Atankvad Virodhi Samiti, is close to Chauhan and Sawant. His celebrity friends include singers Daler Mehndi, hairstylist Sylvie, and actor Nagma. Next time you see them in Parliament, you'll know where the invite came from.

AKHILESH

GREAT ESCAPE
khilesh Yadav was the star of the first day of Parliament on March 12. From his favourite food (paneer) to his favourite music band (Metallica), Akhilesh trivia was the talk of Parliament. It also meant the horde around Akhilesh made it impossible for him to reach his car. Finally it was CPI's Gurudas Dasgupta who rescued him, playing knight in a white ambassador. A grateful Akhilesh sped off with Dasgupta, leading many to comment on the beginning of the Third Front.

ormer CPI(M) chief minister of Kerala, V.S. Achuthanandan, 88, is known for opposing atrocities against women. But he clearly doesn't speak as he acts. On March 11, he said the United Democratic Front (UDF) had lured G. Selvaraj, the MLA who resigned from CPI(M), with many offers. He compared it to how the Congress treated a CPI(M) woman leader, Sindhu Joy. `"The UDF will use and then dump Selvaraj. They did this to Sindhu Joy--used and dumped like a whore." Even Achuthanandan's own party was aghast at the analogy.

fter he took over as Chief Minister of Goa on March 9, Manohar Parrikar first instructed Chief Secretary Sanjay Shrivastava to reduce VIP security. He began with himself. While predecessor Digambar Kamat had a posse of 10 guards, Parrikar wants six. Will he also choose to stay put in his private home instead of the official home, as he did during 2002-2005 when he first became chief minister?

et it not be said that Farooq Abdullah is an unfair man. The flamboyant Union new and renewable energy minister was quite the star at former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh's 70th birthday bash on March 11 at IOA SecretaryGeneral Randhir Singh's Chhattarpur farmhouse in Delhi. Dancing happily to a non-stop medley of bhangra pop, he tried to sound cheery in what became an occasion for mourning after Congress's defeat in the state Assembly elections. But Abdullah was equally happy to breach Punjab's deep political divide and accepted an invitation to join Parkash Singh Badal's fifth swearing-in as Chief Minister three days later.

amil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa was one of the first politicians to call Akhilesh Yadav after the Samajwadi Party swept Uttar Pradesh. She told him she wouldn't be able to attend his swearing-in on March 15 as she is busy campaigning for the Sankarankoil by-election. And she had some advice for the state's youngest chief minister: Now that he has been entrusted with a huge responsibility, he will have to deliver. She should know. In 1991, she was Tamil Nadu's youngest chief minister at 43.

"Now we are equal! If Pakistan has Veena Malik, we have Nupur Mehta. Betting on big bucks in cricket is the sexiest sport ever. Nupur scores 100."

They didn't accept my plans to create a separate Purvanchal for speedy development of the region."

"It is clear from its (Congress) performance in five states that the Congress has been weakened. So, it doesn't want to go in for mid-term polls. Instead, it will cling to power till its full term by doing everything to retain a majority in the Lok Sabha."

tudiously avoiding any comment on his recently vanquished rival Amarinder Singh, Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal seems to be training his sights higher, on Rahul Gandhi. Speaking to reporters outside his Safdarjung Road home in Delhi on March 12, Badal said NDA should ask Rahul to tour the entire country because "wherever Rahul goes, Congress loses".
