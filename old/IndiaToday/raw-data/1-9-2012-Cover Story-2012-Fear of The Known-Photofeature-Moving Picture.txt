MOVING PICTURE

INDIA TODAY N JANUARY 9, 2012

IN SECOND GEAR Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi at a function to mark the 10th anniversary of the Parliament attack, in New Delhi on December 13. Corporate scandals, governance in a rut and an economy in freefall have made it a year of non-stop embarrassment for the twin towers of UPA.

A gritty Gandhian with a mission. Four seasons of scams, with jail for some, bail for others. Tragedies, at home and abroad, partly salved by the World Cup victory of the Men in Blue. Osama bin Laden's grisly end in Abbottabad, Pakistan, after a decade-long hunt. A new beginning in West Asia. Iconic images of 2011 have become embedded in our collective psyche.

ONE-WOMAN ARMY Trinamool Congress supporters at a rally in Kolkata on July 21. Mamata Banerjee stormed the Left's strongest bastion. She became Bengal's reigning deity. Her aura extended to the Centre.

DISCOVERY OF INDIA The Prince who would be King has made Uttar Pradesh his battlefield. From speaking up for Bhatta-Parsaul farmers to sympathising with Uttar Pradesh migrants, Rahul Gandhi has staked his political future on the state that is inseparable from his political ancestry.

DANGEROUS GAMES The Commonwealth Games excesses shamed the nation. Later, Suresh Kalmadi was behind bars in one of the most spectacular declines in recent times. RAISING THE BAR Even as A. Raja languished in jail, the 2G scam gave India a new vocabulary, from `coalition dharma' to `notional loss' .

PRINCESS IN PRISON The 2G scam trail led to the door of A. Raja's alleged partner-incrime, Kanimozhi. She spent 193 days in Tihar Jail before getting bail.

"The Solicitor General had approved that whoever fulfils the condition of the Letter of Intent first gets the licence first. I followed his advice and landed in jail. He is enjoying office outside." A. Raja, Former Telecom Minister

MINE THE GAP The Congress plotted the Karnataka strongman's ouster many times without success. Proof of widespread mining irregularities in the Lokayukta report finally nailed B.S.Yeddyurappa.
