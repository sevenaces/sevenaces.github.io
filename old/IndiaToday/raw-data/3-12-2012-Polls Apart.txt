Taking a dig at Rahul's Mission 2012, Akhilesh Yadav said,"In English, whenever you add a Miss to anything, your work never gets done. Like `fortunate' becomes mis-fortunate." So now is the Congress getting English lessons from the Samajwadi Party?

"Sonia Gandhi came from Italy and has been accepted here. Rahul should remember this before speaking on his bua (aunt)."

BEHENJI
Three power women wowed the cow belt with oratory, charm and some old-fashioned politics

UMA BHARATI It was BJP chief Nitin Gadkari's idea to introduce Bharati in Uttar Pradesh to bring in the OBC vote in Bundelkhand. Despite a fall that hurt her hip, she made BJP relevant in the poll rhetoric. She claims she is not interested in becoming chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Her heart, it seems, still lies in Madhya Pradesh. Niche Style An idol of Lord Krishna and items for puja. Trademark Talk "Main to aap ke aangan ki Tulsi hoon (I am the Tulsi plant in your courtyard)" .

PRIYANKA GANDHI Her SPG calls her Bhaiyyaji. Priyanka seems to play the role of Big Brother with ease. For the first time, she spoke on issues outside the family, defending Union ministers P. Chidambaram and Salman Khurshid. Rumours are afloat of her planning a bigger political role. Accessory The aam aadmi. Either she is pulling someone's cheek or lecturing a housewife on healthcare. Poll Talk "Many states are reaping the benefits of the Central Government's welfare schemes. You can, too, if you have a Congress government."

MAYAWATI Her rallies are still the biggest draw in the state. Realising that she is more popular than her MLAs, she distances herself from them, asking people to vote for her. Must Have A sheet of paper with her speech written on it. Yet no one jokes that she is a reader and not a leader. Favourite Line "Yeh maan ke chalo ki yeh vote inko nahin deh rahe ho, apni Dalit behen aur beti ko de rahe ho (Think that you are casting your vote not for the candidate but for me, your Dalit sister and daughter)."

P.L. PUNIA

"Punia is from Punjab and has nothing to do with Barabanki. What work does he have here? We will win all the six seats."
D.P. YADAV
Ex-BSP MLA, ON JANUARY 6

"I am not an outsider. Beni has not been projected as the sole leader during the UP polls. It is a collective leadership." , "If he thinks I am a kid, let him be happy with that. We will continue to work in the manner best suited for people of UP."
SP LEADER ON JANUARY 6

AKHILESH YADAV

"Akhilesh is a kid and is quite immature. He has just walked out of the school (of politics) and will take some time to learn."

WON FOR THE ALBUM
Politics became a family affair as daughters, wives and sisters helped woo the voter

 FAMILY STRONGHOLD PRIYANKA GANDHI TOOK HER TWO CHILDREN, 12-YEAR-OLD RAIHAN AND 10-YEAR-OLD MIRAYA, TO THE CAMPAIGN, JUST AS RAJIV GANDHI TOOK HER AND RAHUL WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN.

THE SPOILERS
These four leaders have reinvented `nuisance value'
AZAM KHAN There are some who say that Azam Khan, Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA, is a Muslim leader only among Hindus. The party's Muslim face has spent the better part of the election sulking against his own party than campaigning. MANPREET BADAL Sukhbir Badal's estranged cousin believes his People's Party of Punjab has `spoilt it' both for the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP combine and Congress. But has he spoilt it enough to make him kingmaker? BENI PRASAD VERMA Rahul Gandhi brought him in hoping he would woo the Kurmi vote away from his former party, SP. His men got the largest number of tickets, as many as 105. But the prominence given to him has angered the state Congress. BABU LAL KUSHWAHA BJP was divided over the former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) minister's induction into the party. But he still has a hold on the OBC vote. So what if he occasionally confuses his rhetoric and lashes out at BJP instead of BSP.
by Ashish Misra and Asit Jolly

Rahul Gandhi said he was angry and rolled up his sleeves.The Congress spent the entire campaign trying to explain his anger.

The Election Commission's move to cover elephants gave Mayawati a serious poll grouse: Persecution of a Dalit woman.

Waving Apple laptops,Akhilesh Yadav announced the arrival of a modern Samajwadi Party.Whether the makeover works or not, it has catapulted Akhilesh to national fame.

The crowd loved it when Priyanka got cheeky with Sonia. Family charisma was on display in Amethi and Rae Bareli.Will choreographed spontaneity bring in the votes?

10 WAYS TO FOOL THE EC
1 Instead of giving money to people, candidates gave coupons for petrol, gifts, ornaments and even cash. 6 Candidates attended weddings and birthdays of voters, distributing lavish gifts, sometimes even cash.

2 Gram pradhans (village chiefs) 7 Relatives were fielded as dummy were used as `vote managers' and cash candidates to get around the Election distributed through them. Commission's (EC) expenditure cap of Rs 16 lakh for each candidate. 3 Candidates sent supporters on old motorcycles instead of SUVs to ferry cash to escape scrutiny. 4 An average of Rs 2,000 was given to each `polling agent' to bring voters to the polling booth. 5 In the border districts, the candidates arranged parties in Nepal and sent small groups to attend them. 8 Financial donations were given to religious institutions to woo their voters and keep them happy. 9 Candidates and parties used social networking sites for campaigning since EC had banned hoardings. 10 Supporters of candidates organised tea parties on a large scale.
