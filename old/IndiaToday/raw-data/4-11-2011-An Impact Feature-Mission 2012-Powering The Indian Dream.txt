POWERING THE INDIAN DREAM

T

HE NEED to provide sustainable power at competitive prices to each household and commercial enterprise across India continues to pose a challenge forthe government The power sector is crucial to the country's infrastructure and a key element in enabling growth in the Indian economy. However, the ever-increasing electricity demand, fuelled by the post-liberalisation boom in economy, has led to a widening ;ap between the supply and demand. The national electricity policy hopes to bridge this gap. This policy is being promoted by the Ministry of Power as "Mission 2012: Power for AH" with the objective of providing adequate, reliable, affordable and quality power. The power generation strategy will nowfocus on low-cost generation, optimisation of capacity utilisation, controlling the input cost, optimisation of fuel mix, technology upgradation and utilisation of non-conventional energy sources. While Union Minister for Power Shri Sushilkumar Shinde believes that the growth of the power sector should be more than the growth rate of the economy for the country to gain power sufficiency, the road that lies ahead is dotted with innumerable challenges. But the phenomenal growth shown by the Ministry of Power under the leadership of Shri Sushilkumar Shinde has shown a ray of hope with the addition of more than 48000 MW in the installed capacity during the last 5 years which is more than total capacity added during the last decade and addition of 33762 MW during the current llth Plan, which is 160% of total capacity added during the 10th Plan. During the year 2010-11, a capacity addition of 11460 MW has been done by 25.3.2011 which is highest in a single year during the last 60 years. This growth has received appreciation from the Finance Minister Shri Pranab Mukherjee during the recent Budget Session.

POWER NEEDS:

The power requirement in India is expected to grow manifold in the comingyears as a result of industrial and urban expansion. According to the McKinsey report, India's demand for power will soar to as much as 3,15,000 MW by 2017, requiring an investment of $600 billion (Rs 25,80,000 crore) if the economy keeps its pace of growth at 8%. To fulfill power requirement of about 3,15,000 MW, an extra 1,00,000 MW is needed because of plant availability adjustments. The key drivers of an increased power demand is growth in household consumption, electrification of rural areas, rapid manufacturing growth etc. Household consumption itself is expected to grow at 14% per annum. According to experts, such massive targets can be achieved only by distribution reforms, including separation of agricultural feeders and reduction of transmission losses. CAPACITY ADDITION: India has the fifth largest generation capacity in the world with an overall installed capacity of 1,71,926 MW as on 28th February, 2011, which shows a capacity addition of 38.7% over January 2006 when the capacity was 123,901 MW. This is. around 4% of global power generation. The Indian government has set ambitious goals in the llth Plan for the power sector, which is now poised for significant expansion. In order to facilitate over 1,000 units of per capita electricity by 2012, has led to massive plans being proposed in the sub-sectors of Generation, Transmission and Distribution. With focus on increasing generation capacity over the next ten years, the corresponding investments in the transmission sector are also likely to enhance, The Ministry of Power intends to set up an Integrated National Power Grid by 2012 with 28,000 MW of inter-regional power transfer capacity. Considering that the

With India still dependent on conventional form of power generation, how are we geared up to face international debate on green house gas emissions? National Electricity Policy aims to exploit all possible resources to meet the demand of electricity in an efficient and cost effective manner. To meetthe future demand of electricity, we are developing non-conventional and clean sources of energy like hydro power, solar power and wind power etc. Introduction of new supercritical technology, enhancing efficiency of generation through R&M, mixing of fuels are a few measures to minimize carbon footprint in the thermal power plants. What has the progress been on the village electrification policy under the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY)? The progress under RGGVY has been very good. As on 15.3.2011; 95000 villages have been electrified and free connections of electricity has been released to 155 lakh rural BPL households. This has benefitted about 8 crore people. We will complete electrification of 1.15 lakh unelectrified villages by 2012. How are we geared to face the fuel shortage crisis as we come up with more new Projects? As far as coal is concerned, it is a fact that domestic coal production is not keeping pace with the growing demand for coal based power plants - for both - new plants as well as the generating plants. For example, for the year 2009-10, against the total coal requirement of 404 Million Tonnes the anticipated availability of indigenous coal was 363 Million Tonnes only. Accordingly, the Power Utilities were advised to import coal to meet the balance requirement of coal. For the year 2010-11 against the requirement of 434 Million Tonnes coal for the power plants the total availability of indigenous coal is expected to be 388 Million tonnes only. Hence target of import of coal has been fixed at 35 Million Tonnes. In addition to this, 12 Million Tonnes coal is to be imported for the power plants designed forthe imported coal. Supply of coal by Coal India Limited to the Power Utilities during last few years has been falling short of requirement for meeting the electricity generation target and building stock of coal at the power stations upto normative level. The problem will further aggravate from the year 2011-12 in view of accelerated generation, capacity addition and limitations in blending beyond 10 to 15% of the total coal consumption of the unit. We have taken up these issues with Ministry of Coal and Ministry of Environment & Forests. Hon'ble Prime Minister has already constituted a Group of Ministers to look into these issues. With a number of energy conservation initiatives that have been taken up, do you think we will achieve the projected increase in avoided capacity? We are constantly workingtowards improving energy efficiency in the country. With the success of mandatory labeling on the four products and several other initiatives such as the Energy Conservation Building Code, Bachat Lamp Yojana, Agriculture and Municipal DSM programmes, Designated Consumers and SME's, India is estimated to have saved 5,000 MW in the first three years of the 11th Five Year Plan. We estimate the avoided generation capacity to go beyond 10,000 MW by the end of 11th Plan, which is the targetforthe plan period. Given that India is on an higher growth trajectory, how do you see the road ahead for power sector in India? Notwithstanding the significant performance of the power sector during the last five years, the task ahead remains challenging and there is no scope for complacency. The power sector has to grow at a faster pace for the economy to grow at 9 to 10% over the next five years. The Ministry of Power is well geared to meet this challenge. The projects that will bring in this quantum of power have tied-up various inputs, achieved financial closure and are at various stages of construction. The Ministry has identified a set of strategic initiatives to not only achieve but to surpass these targets. These include strengthening of tracking, measuringand monitoring systems including extension of web-based monitoring system. To ensure timely supply of quality power equipment, the Ministry is taking steps for augmentation of indigenous manufacturing capacity of power equipment, particularly, balance of plant and adherence to equipment charter. Project developers are being encouraged across the power value chain to avoid overloading of vendors beyond their annual delivery capacity. Measures are being taken for ensuring fuel security, and promoting usage of state of the art technology and strengthening the skills eco-system in the power sector.

SHRISUSHILKUMAR SHINDE Hon'ble Union Minister of Power

How far are we from our objective "Mission 2012: Power for All"? Electricity is a vital input for economic and social development in our society. Besides its importance in the growth of the country's economy, it plays a major role in the life of a common man and has a direct impact on the quality of life. Ministry of Power is working with a vision and suitable strategies have been devised for power generation, transmission, distribution and rural electrification. Our endeavor and commitment, therefore, is to provide reliable, affordable and quality power to all users. "Power for all by 2012" is goal of my Ministry. During the current Five Year Plan a capacity of 33,762 MW has already been added which is 160% higher than the total capacity addition of 21,180 MW achieved during the Tenth Plan period and projects about 30,000 MW are under construction for benefit during llth Plan. During the year 2010-11 we have added 11460 MW capacity till 25.3.2011 which is highest in a single year during the last 60 years. More than 79,000 MW capacity is under construction during the 12th Plan. With this level of capacity addition, the country is likely to be self sufficient to meetthe rising demand for power in a few years. With the revision of the projected target capacity addition in the mid-term appraisal of the llth Plan are we seeing a gap between the plan and delivery? As per Mid Term Appraisal, the capacity addition during 11th Plan is 62,374 MW. A total of 33,762 MW capacity has already been added during the current Plan. Installed capacity have gone up from 1,23,901 MW during January 2006 to 1,71,926 in February 2011, with addition of 48,000 MW during last five years which is more than the total capacity added duringthe last decade. I don't foresee any gap between target and achievement. We will be adding more than three times the capacity added duringthe 10th Plan. The projected inter-regional power transfer capacity of 37,700 MW seems to be a little ambitious considering the current transfer capacity. Your opinion on the same? Development of transmission is always in tandem with capacity addition. The inter-regional transmission capacity has increased from meager 9500 MW to 22400 MW as of now and by the end of 11th Plan it would be 28,000 MW. While some progress has been made in reducing the Transmission and Distribution losses, but these are still very high at 33%, what are we doing to address this? The biggest challenge in the power sector as of today is the high level of AT&C losses, which is in the purview of State Governments. Central Government has launched the R-APDRP scheme for revamping distribution sector during llth Plan with a total outlay of Rs.51,577 crore to reduce the AT&C losses upto 15%.. Projects under the scheme are beingtaken up in two Parts. Part-A includes the projects for establishment of baseline data and IT applications for energy accounting/auditing, CIS, consumer indexing, SCADA & IT based consumer service centers etc. Part-B includes regular distribution strengthening projects including separation of agricultural feeders from domestic and industrial ones and High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) etc. Under Part-A of R-APDRP, 1401 projects at an estimated cost of Rs 5846.10 crore have been approved in respect of 29 States/UTs. Under Part-B of R-APDRP so far 823 projects at an estimated cost of Rs.15,974.59 crore have been approved for 14 States. Due to the above measures, AT&C losses in the country have reduced from 34.78% in 2003-04 to 28.44% in 2008-09 and I hope that the situation will improve further in the nearf uture.
