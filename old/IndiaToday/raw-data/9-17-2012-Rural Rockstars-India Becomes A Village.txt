he underlying visual of many in urban India is a rural India marked by thatched roofs, kutcha roads, and uneducated people who work in farms. But the village has changed dramatically from the days of Sholay. Rural India has been growing more rapidly than urban India in the last few years and studies by many organisations are only now capturing what my colleagues at Indicus had gathered some time back. Rural unemployment fell by

3.9 million in the period between 200405 and 2009-10, according to the National Sample Survey (NSS). Incomes are also growing faster--a 2011 Credit Suisse report found per capita GDP in rural India has grown 1.5 per cent more than urban India: 6.2 per cent in rural areas against 4.7 per cent in urban ones. As per a CRISIL report penned by Dhamakriti Joshi using NSS data, rural household expenditures grew by Rs 3.7 trillion between 2009-10 and 2011-212, compared to less than Rs 3 trillion in urban India. The growth in rural India was 2 percentage points higher during the pe-

riod. Meanwhile, education attainment is improving more rapidly than in urban India; even in household assets, more two-wheelers and TVS are being used by India's rural inhabitants (see graphs). These changes have occurred not merely because of productivity improvements in agriculture (marginal), or NREGA (slightly more than a drop in the ocean) or even higher minimum support prices (few commodities covered for a small part of rural economy). There have been massive and obvious, though undocumented, productivity improvements in rural India, including in its manufacturing and services

sectors. Today, manufacturing and services account for almost three-fourths (73 per cent8to be precise) of the rural economy, and will only grow in future. These productivity improvements 6.2 6 have occurred on the back of three developments in the 2000s.

K. NICHOLSON SINGH 31
WONGKIEI KOIJAM LEIKAI, MANIPUR

Inventor

K. NICHOLSON SINGH, 31, turned
an innovator out of a sense of guilt. In 2002, a stray dog he used to often feed, died of shock after it accidentally sat on a naked wire at his electrical repair shop. He did not tell anyone how it had died, but shut shop for a month, refusing to speak to friends and family. "It was my carelessness, but it made me want to find a remedy. I asked my father, an electrician himself, if there was any device that absorbed electric shocks. He had no answer. I checked local libraries, but it was a waste of time," says Singh, who won the Grassroots Innovator Award in 2009 from the National Innovation Foundation for designing an electric shock-proof converter. Though not marketed commercially yet, it comes in various sizes, depending on the voltage rating of the device. "The principle is simple. I use a magnetic field to make the surge shock-proof. You plug one end of the converter to the power source, the other end to any device--fridge, TV, iron or even naked wires--and you won't get a shock," he explains. Born on March 25, 1981, in village Wongkiei Koijam Leikai, 5 km from Imphal, Singh was exposed to the world of electricity from childhood, as Indrajit, his father, was an electrician at Imphal's RIMS Hospital. "I learnt practical aspects of the trade from my father. But he could never explain how things worked. For that, while in Class VIII, I trained for three months under Momom Singh of ITI." In 2000, Singh borrowed money from friends to start his shop. It was here that three years later, fate intervened, and he ended up designing the converter. by Kaushik Deka

MEET HIMANSHU Patel,
one of India's best sarpanchs. In six years, he has transformed the sleepy, garbage-littered village of Punsri, Gujarat, into a model of rural life. Patel was elected in 2006. He immediately got a Rs 4.5lakh sound system with speakers installed in the village. It is connected to his mobile, and allows him to call villagers to assembly in minutes. It has been such a success that 500 panchayats in Gujarat alone have adopted it. Punsri now has a bottledwater plant, a Rs 10-lakh bus and home garbage collection. Patel won the Rajiv Gandhi Bharat Ratna as India's best sarpanch in 2011. His next target: solar street lights.by Uday Mahurkar

`gentle breeze' in Urdu. And 30-year-old Sabbah Haji is the fresh breath of air that has bypassed Jammu & Kashmir for two decades, but is now back in the inhospitable heights of Doda district. Four years after she quit

the comfort of her content-writing job in Bangalore, she's in the thick of an incredible transformation. In 2008, Haji went back to her village of Breswana, a remote settlement of 1,500 people. "I felt there were far more relevant things I should be

doing back home, instead of earning and spending in a latherrinse-repeat cycle month after month," she wrote on her blog. The commerce graduate from Bishop Cotton, Bangalore, spent the next few months setting up Haji Public School (HPS).

From two rooms of her father Saleem Haji's home in May 2009, HPS today has its own building and nearly 200 children on its rolls, besides two branches, in Parsholla and Shadiwan. Four years on, HPS has Classes I to V with no dropouts. Striking a

happy mix of modernity and tradition between her Levi's and hijab, she says it helps that she likes village life: "It's simple and the people are real." For Haji, it's been a happy descent to the uncomplicated--to the delight of watching a child's face light up with comprehension. by Asit Jolly

He went on to work at firms such as LightSand Communications, Wipro, LVL7 Systems, Intel and Cisco. But a void remained. "I lived in the US for almost two years and could have settled there. But I had a conscience-call--that I should use my success to help others," he says. He

returned to Bangalore in 2003, and realised he could give back most by extending to his community the benefits of technology. His mind made up, he left Cisco in August 2010 to set up VT, which builds cost-effective IT solutions for agriculture. Its first product, Kisan Raja, was launched in early 2011. "It's a GSMbased software that makes a cellphone work as an irrigation pump switch," says Dinnepu. At Rs 5,000 per unit, it's already being used by over 500 farmers in the state. by Sonali Acharjee

IF MAHATMA GANDHI believed India lives in its villages, a young couple has ensured that the village they have adopted lives well. In five years, Jaldeep Thakar and his wife Snehal have spun a remarkable turnaround for Pedhamli in Mehsana district, be it in education, health, hygiene or women's empowerment and entrepreneurship. Jaldeep imbibed the Mahatma's vision of rural sufficiency at Gujarat Vidyapith, a university founded in 1920 by Gandhi himself. Once they settled in Pedhamli in 2006, from health issues, they moved to reviving a cooperative dairy. They opted against floating an NGO, saying Pedhamli is their NGO and its inhabitants their trustees. by Uday Mahurkar

A FILM AT 17 may not sound that
big an achievement, till you realise Jayshree Kharpade's father forced her out of school in Class II, so that she could work at a brick kiln. Fire in Our Hearts, her 27-minute autobiopic, won first prize at the AsianAmerican International Film Festival in New York in July. In it, the tribal girl from Wada, 120 km from Mumbai, narrates her struggle to get an education. Now in Class X at Eklavya Vidyalaya in Usgaon, 70 km north of Mumbai, Kharpade exudes the confidence of a girl determined to make up for lost time. "At 12, NGO Shramajeevi Sanghathana re-enrolled me in Class II," she says. "I picked up so fast that my school allowed me to sit for the annual exams of Classes III-VI. I cleared them all." There's no rancour at her father for pulling her out of school, though, in the film, she asks him why he forced her to abandon school. "Now, baba wants me study further," she says. Kharpade had not seen a camera until filmmaker Joyce Chopra of New York-based NGO BYkids visited her school in December 2010, and warmed to her story. Chopra encouraged Kharpade to shoot, and edited the film. Her film's success has sharpened Kharpade's focus. She wants to be a civil engineer and build a school in her village, so that no girl is deprived of an education. by Kiran Tare

AT AN ANNUAL salary of Rs 1.05
crore from his club, Prayag United, and Rs 65 lakh a year from All India Football Federation, 26-year-old Gouramangi AWANG SEKMAI, Singh is India's second-highest MANIPUR paid footballer. But for this softFootballer spoken defender from Awang Sekmai, 17 km north of Imphal, investment in Indian football is not taking the right direction. "One thing our football lacks is investment in youth and infrastructure. National team players get to play abroad, but it's important for every region to have good academies, right training, nourishment and technical assistance. India is not short of talent, but we need to be groomed to be at par with the best," says Gouramangi. Though born in football-crazy Manipur, Singh's rise to stardom has not been easy. The big break came in 2003 when he captained India's under-18 team that won the Ian Rush Trophy in Ireland. The next year, he was selected for the Tata Football Academy (TFA) in Jamshedpur. "Renedy Singh, also from Manipur, was a star when I joined TFA. It was my first step in his footsteps," says Gouramangi. His struggles began once he left TFA. "From being one of India's most promising players, I struggled in Mohun Bagan. It's only after I joined Churchill in 2007 that I settled down," says Singh. In 2007, he was in India's firstever Nehru Cup-winning team. He rates the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup victory higher--it gave them a chance to play in the AFC Asian Cup. "Sharing the same space with South Koreans and Australians was amazing," he says. At 6'1", he is one of India's tallest players. His headers are feared by opponents. On September 2, 2012, Gouramangi scored the first goal, a header, as India beat Cameroon to lift the Nehru Cup for the third time. by Kaushik Deka

IN MANDVA, A VILLAGE
of about 11,000 people on the banks of the Narmada near Chandod, Vadodara district, Gujarat, Mehul Panchal Chand has created a forested ravine in the midst of barren land, appropriately called Oasis Valley. Racked by guilt at farmer

suicides in Gujarat, this organic farm was his gift to the community he feels he belongs to. Panchal qualified as an electronics engineer from M.S. University, Vadodara, in 1993. He landed a job at an IT firm in Bangalore, but unhappy with it, a year on he made a life-changing decision to move back to Vadodara and immerse himself in the uplift of the nearby villages. He bought a nine-acre barren plot nearby for a meagre Rs 35,000 in 2002. With continuous experiments over 10 years, he

has turned it into a fertile valley, and has inspired over 400 farmers to his cause, that of sustainable but economically viable organic farming. "I'm inspired by India's organic farming pioneers Ashok Sanghavi, Bhaskar Hiraji Save and Subhash Palekar," he says. Organic farmers like Panchal rear earthworms to turn compost to manure,

and use cow urine as insecticide. He says: "With chemicals, the land needs more fertilisers in the next period. Pests become immune, and a ruinous downward spiral ensues." Panchal believes a farmer with just two acres can be richer than a small-town engineer. But first, "you need to be one of them".

"Meetei sir motivated me to join an advanced mountaineering course in Darjeeling in 2009," she says. She soon started dreaming of scaling Mount Everest. It didn't take long: On May 29, 2011, she became the first person from the North-east to do so. Mane's feat was nearly a non-starter for lack of funds. The Jindal Group pitched in with Rs 15 lakh; and a fundraising drive by two state legislators, Laeta Umbrey and Rajesh Tacho, raised another Rs 10 lakh.

KUMARAVEL PREMKUMAR, 19, is on his mark. In
a flash he's running, long limbs flying, till he lands, kicking up a sandy halo around him. The Pachiyappas School ground in

Chennai is strewn with paper cups and garbage-- not the training facility that befits India's junior long jump champion. But he isn't bothered. It's his home. "I live here with seven other athletes," says Premkumar, who set a national record of 7.86 m in the junior level in Bangalore in 2010, and topped it with 7.92 m at the Asian Indoor Athletics Championship trials in January 2012. Hailing from Orthanadu

old, and I didn't know if I could live away from my mother," says Premkumar. His mother, Uma Rani, who worked as a cook in the local diocese church to make both ends meet, initially said no. "I had to convince her that this is what I wanted to do, that if I had to achieve something as an athlete, I would have to avail of better facilities and training in Chennai," says the champion. Premkumar's trophy

cabinet includes bronze medals from several Asian meets. He finished 8th at the IAAF World Junior Championships in Barcelona in July. Premkumar admits he has a long way to go, but his

long-term goal is to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics. For now, passing high school is a priority. "I failed in the commerce paper. I'm going to sit for it again this October," he says sheepishly. by Lakshmi Kumaraswami

trict, Haryana, Yogeshwar Dutt is a man with a Midas touch. "You see that huge water tank? That is part of a new domestic water supply BHAINSWAL KALAN, gifted by our champion," says 40-year-old Raju HARYANA Sharma, who teaches in an Ayurvedic college Wrestler, Olympic nearby. Since 2006, when it was declared a Bronze Medallist `model village' after Dutt began winning international wrestling medals, Bhainswal now has streetlights, concrete-lined streets and a sewage system. No wonder then that a thousand jubilant residents carried the Olympic bronze medallist from Delhi airport on August 14. "The cheers get wilder each time I return with a medal. What more can one ask for?" says Dutt. Born to schoolteachers Ram Meher Sharma and Sushila Devi, Dutt showed early inclination for wrestling. His early mentors were his own parents. He was eight years old when Sharma packed him off to Delhi's Chhatrasal Stadium. There he trained under Satpal Pehalwan, alongside Olympic silver medallist Sushil Kumar. Like many other wrestlers, Kumar loves coming to Bhainswal. "Dutt's mother is like my own and spoils us no end," he says. There is still no place like home for Dutt. It's where Sushila polishes the trophies won by her son each morning, and hopes to bring back a "gunwaan aur susheel (accomplished and pleasant)" bride for Dutt very soon. by Asit Jolly

EVERY NIGHT, Mohammad Ismat would study under street lights. Haoreibi Mayai Leikai, his village in Lilong, Imphal, suffers 11-12-hour power cuts a day. To crown it, six months before Class XII finals, he underwent an emergency surgery. Still, Ismat topped the 2012 all-India CBSE exam with 99.6 per cent marks. The 18-year-old has battled adversity since he lost his mother when he was 18 months old."My father had Rs 2,000 a month to raise us," he says.

Businessman and Philanthrophist

NAVAL KISHORE Godara, 39, looks at the impressive building of his high school, Saraswati Vidya Mandir, with justifiable pride. This is where 1,800 students from a dozen villages within 30 km of Bhinyad, his village in Barmer, Rajasthan, study. He built it two years ago to provide quality education in this backward area. His fa-

ther was illiterate and he dropped out from Class VIII. In 1987, Godara left to work at salt factories in Rajkot and Gandhidham, where he sealed salt packets and loaded 50 kg bags on trucks on his fragile frame. He earned Rs 1,500 a month as a daily labourer. "I wanted to do something big. In my spare time, I served my employer Mohammad bin-Abdullah, and observed him for clues to success," he says. He carried out Abdullah's personal tasks and looked after his guests.

Godara's sincerity and honesty impressed Abdullah. One day, he even expressed concern for him: "If you keep carrying such heavy loads, you won't live long." Godara worked here for four years. Then one day, he asked Shahabuddin, a visitor from the Democratic Republic of Congo, to take him abroad. He arranged for him to emigrate. In Congo, Godara picked up French in six months, and was soon looking after Shahabuddin's cosmetics shops. In 10 years, he built

contacts with cellphone sellers, as well as copper and cobalt miners. In 2001, he set up his own business in cosmetics, expanding to cellphones and copper. Already, he has a billion-dollar turnover. Two years ago, he sent his wife, Verju Devi, and three children back to Jodhpur, to imbibe Indian culture, and set up his school, before he returned himself. The school has buses for students living in far-flung areas. Godara implemented Right to Education to provide free education to 25 per cent students and charges Rs 250 a month from other children. These days, he is busy organising a district cricket tournament in his school. by Rohit Parihar

Businessman

"MY NAME IS Hanmantrao Gaikwad," the five-yearold introduced himself on his first day at school in Rahimatpur village, Satara, Maharashtra. The honorific `Rao' took the teacher by surprise, but then, Gaikwad, chairman and managing director of India's largest housekeeping firm, the Rs 1,000-crore Bharat Vikas Group (BVG), took pride in himself from an early age. Son of Ramdas, a Pune sessions court clerk, he would sell fruit at Pune's railway station to supplement the

family income. Their struggles increased when his father passed away in 1990, but his mother took a loan of Rs 15,000 for him to study BTech at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune. Gaikwad joined Telco, now Tata Motors (TM), in Pune in 1994. He soon impressed his supervisors, who let him launch his own firm and recruit eight villagers from Rahimatpur as housekeepers in 1997. TM, his first client, contracted him to maintain its Indica plant near Pune, and he quit his job. BVG'S clients now include Rashtrapati Bhavan, Delhi High Court, Prime Minister's residence, Parliament House, etc. "My goal is a turnover of Rs 10,000 crore in three years," says a confident Gaikwad. by Kiran Tare

"YOU CAN DESCRIBE MY village
as ganna, gehun aur goli (sugarNAWAZUDDIN cane, wheat and bullet)," says Nawazuddin Siddiqui, 38. He SIDDIQUI 38 could well be talking about BUDHANA, Wasseypur, and his role as the UTTAR PRADESH drug-addled, gun-toting mafia Actor don Faisal Khan in Anurag Kashyap's hit films, Gangs of Wasseypur I and II. "There are many Wasseypurs in India. My village is one," he says, of Budhana, Muzaffarnagar district, Uttar Pradesh. Electricity is a luxury in this village of 33,000 people and even an hour's uninterrupted supply is cause for celebration. Dacoity, murder and honour killings are commonplace. As part of a large family of farmers--he is the oldest of seven brothers and two sisters--he worked in the family's fields, and tended their cattle, while growing up. Two of his films, Gangs of Wasseypur and Miss Lovely, were shown at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, but acting wasn't on his mind when he passed out of DAV Inter College, Budhana. He moved to Haridwar to study chemistry at Gurukul Kangri University, and then to

Vadodara as chief chemist at a petrochemical factory. A friend took him to watch a play and he recalls thinking "yeh sahi cheez hai (this is the real deal)". He joined Delhi's National School of Drama in 1993, and shifted to Mumbai in 2000, that ushered in a long period of struggle, that only turned in 2010 with his role in Peepli [Live]. Today, he has 13 films that either await release or are ready to be shot. Earlier, he'd be paid Rs 500-Rs 1,000 a day for bit roles. In the last two years, his earnings have risen eight times, "and a thousand times overall". Even now, home remains his inspiration. As a child, he mimicked those around him. "Film people have rarely seen the world outside. I've seen the characters I play, for real." It was a childhood crush on a girl next door that propelled Siddiqui to his profession. Her conservative Muslim family made it difficult for him to approach her. When he managed, though, she chose to ignore him for a TV serial. Spurned, he promised to appear on TV one day. And when he finally did, he asked a friend back home to remind her, but unfortunately she was married by then. That, of course, is just a footnote, for Bollywood's latest shooting star is now happily married, with 20-month-old daughter Shora bringing joy to his life. by Nishat Bari

HE WAS STILL SHY of 16 when he
gave in to wanderlust, to explore the world beyond Harsour, a small village in Himachal Pradesh's hilly HARSOUR, HIMACHAL PRADESH Hamirpur district. Unlike his peers, who headed for lucrative Shooter, Olympic jobs in the metros, Vijay Kumar folSilver Medallist lowed his father, Subedar Bankuram Sharma, into the Indian Army. Recalling early signs of his son's prowess, Bankuram says: "He was precise even in the way he cut and stacked grass for our buffaloes, when he was barely seven." It was this single-mindedness that drew him to competitive shooting, shortly after he enlisted as a sepoy in his father's regiment, 16 Dogra, in 2003. Witnessing the young soldier's ability to repeatedly hit bull's eye at arms training, instructors pushed him to the Army marksmanship trials. He never looked back, having won 110 national and 45 international medals in eight years, crowning it with Olympic glory. "Seena chaura kar diya hai mere bete ne (My son made my chest swell with pride)," says Bankuram. The village that helped raise the champion is agog. "Who could've imagined that a Harsour youngster would make the world stand up?" says the proud father. "It's all because of Jwala Mata's blessings," insists Roshini Devi, his devout mother. Inspired Harsour youngsters are already honing their marksmanship skills with catapults. With Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal promising a "world-class sports shooting facility" at Hamirpur, Vijay Kumar's success could usher the dawn of a revolution in marksmanship in this quiet corner of India. by Asit Jolly

THE WORLD HAS many ugly corners. One of them is the world of orphaned children. There are dozens of them in Ahmedabad's railway station, victims of exploitation by unsavoury elements of society. But 18 of them have found saviours in Sanjay Bhavsar, 47, and and his wife Tula Patel, 44, who run a unique orphanage at Bansa village near Visnagar, Gujarat, where they transform lives through innovative festivals and camps. Their traumatic stories, of lives on station staircases, addiction and sexual exploitation, are too grisly for Hollywood makeovers. Both Sanjay and Tula went to village schools. When they met in Ahmedabad, Sanjay was pursuing BTech, while Tula was studying commerce. They fell in love and got married, united in their desire to serve rural India. In 1993, they floated Vishwagram, an NGO, which began by serving the poor and the youth. Then in 2006, they decided to take up the cause of the orphaned children. They tracked down some with the help of NGO Childline, and with a large donation, built an orphanage at Basna. The world of the children here is truly unique. The duo set about transforming the children's lives by changing their habits and influencing their tastes, weaning them away from their tragic pasts. Here, they attend festivals of films, books, theatre and sculpture that showcase wholesome classics, and are organised in collaboration with artistes. These run for a week, but leave an indelible impression on the children's lives. by Uday Mahurkar
