FRENCH SUMMER
India is set to shine again at this year's Cannes Film Festival.This time it will be filmmakers and husbandwife duo Triparna Banerjee, 26, and National Award winner Shivajee Chandrabhushan, 40.Their script titled The Untold Tale has been selected among 15 scripts from 14 countries for L'Atelier, a part of the cine foundation programme, which introduces independ-

TROPHY GIRL
Sonam Kapoor, 26, took the sting out of the Ghanta Awards by actually turning up to claim her trophy for Mausam. She won the `WTF Was That' Ghanta for not managing to exchange a phone number with Shahid Kapoor's character over 10 years. The Indian version of the Razzies rewards the worst of Bollywood. She accepted the award with "Thank you so much! I finally won an award!" She can laugh at herself, but wonder who she was picking on when she tweeted, "Dear publicist, it's not necessary to tear someone down to prop someone up. Ms Wannabe Fashionista has enough cred to do it on her own."
BEDFORD

PLAYING GAMES
Hockey is going the cricket way. Adding to its new-found glamour is Sarah-Jayne Bedford, 26. The leggy South African is presenting World Series Hockey, which is being played across India and aired in over 300 countries. Bedford, a former model, is also a professional hockey player and has represented her country in national-level games. She is popular for the travel show Life's A Beach, where she frolicked in the sun on some of the world's best beaches.

Only a few words of admiration and Akshay Kumar walked away with M.S. Dhoni's gloves that he wore in the match played against Pakistan.

TRAVEL TALES
Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes, 42, is playing on a different field. Only this time he is doing it with words. Rhodes has written a travelogue titled My South African Diary. It was on the insistence of the South African Tourism Board that Rhodes agreed to write the book. Published by Lonely Planet, it also features pictures taken by Rhodes's fiancée, photographer Caroline McClelland.This sure sounds like a scoring partnership.

ent filmmakers to international production houses. The script is a two-hour period drama set in 1950s Barcelona, spanning two continents, 60 years and three generations."A few French actors are reading the script and we will then finalise the Indian cast after Cannes," says Banerjee.

Manisha Koirala, 41, pulled herself together and turned out prim and proper to open an icecream parlour in Mumbai. Not quite the eye candy she was, but way better than her last drunk appearance in January at ex-beau Prashant Chaudhari's restaurantopening party in Mumbai. There is also Lenen Rajendran's Malayalam film Edavapathi. Madhuri Dixit, 44, has her charming smile intact even if she's gone thick around the middle.And so what if filmmakers aren't breaking down her newly relocated door, she has her wax replica at Madame Tussauds in London, dance reality shows to judge and household products to sell.

Sonali Bendre, 37, keeps herself busy judging reality shows--Indian Idol, then two seasons of India's Got Talent. Now she has taken to walking the ramp, like she did for Siddhartha Tytler as his showstopper in a black mini at Lakme Fashion Week. She is also endorsing a furniture brand. Sridevi, 48, contented herself with flaunting her new svelte form in slinky dresses on the red carpet and the occasional walk down the ramp, as her pounds dropped and her hemlines rose. She makes a return to the big screen after a 14-year gap with Gauri Shinde's English Vinglish.
