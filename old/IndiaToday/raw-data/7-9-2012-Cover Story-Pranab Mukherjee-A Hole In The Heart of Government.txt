Cover Story PRANAB MUKHERJEE

AHOLE IN THE HEART OFGOVERNMENT
By Priya Sahgal and Devesh Kumar

As the most seasoned politician in UPA is all set to become president, the struggle for replacement begins

n the evening of Monday, June 25, a day before he resigned as Union finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee took one last walk around the corridors of North Block. He went first to the committee room on the ground floor to attend a farewell by his officers. "Usually, when I resign, it is because we have lost the government. This time, we are not losing the Government. But I am getting a more respectable seat," he said. He also recalled that of the 22 years he has spent as a minister in various Congress governments, almost half that time was in North Block. Misty eyed, he walked back to his room on the first floor. On the way, he told INDIA TODAY, "After I left this office in 1984 (as finance minister) I did not visit North Block until 29 years later." He immediately corrected himself, "No, not 29. I was

made finance minister on January 24, 2009, so it is after 25 years that I came back." He stopped and smiled, "I returned. It was my fate." Fate has now offered Mukherjee a much grander office: In Rashtrapati Bhavan. On his way to hand in his resignation to the Prime Minister on June 26, he told mediapersons outside North Block, "Today, I stand ready to embark on a new journey." As the media thronged him for that last soundbite, he happily obliged: "This is what I will miss. Not being stopped by all of you while getting into my car outside the Ministry of Finance." Then he added, "Sometimes, I have even snubbed you but you have always cooperated." This is precisely what the Congress and UPA will miss: A leader with the stature to snub without offending. Mukherjee's promotion has left a vacuum, both in Government and the party. The technical count is worrying enough: A finance minister; a Leader of the Lok Sabha; a brilliant troubleshooter who can draw at an instant's notice; a political strategist with a detailed memory for dates, precedence and anecdotes; and a senior minister with sufficient credibility to command the attention and respect of colleagues in the intricate business done at GoMs. When Rahul Gandhi called on Mukherjee at North Block on June 25, they had a two-hour meeting. Mukherjee regaled him with stories about his grandmother. Perhaps the young leader too is realising what Manmohan Singh said a few days ago, "It will be very difficult to fill Pranab Mukherjee's shoes." He was the only Cabinet minister who, along with Virbhadra Singh, could trace his lineage back to Indira Gandhi's Cabinet. (Ghulam Nabi Azad only made it as a minister of state in 1982.) It is ironic that the day Mukherjee resigned, so did Virbhadra Singh, albeit for different reasons. In the short term, Manmohan is keeping finance. But, as a finance ministry official pointed out, "We need a full-time finance minister. This is a ministry with five departments and it needs co-ordination with other ministries." Manmohan has hinted at a Cabinet reshuffle soon. Some Congress leaders say that this will happen before the monsoon session. According to a PMO source, the Prime Minister is keen to have either his Chief Economic Adviser C. Rangarajan or Planning Commission Deputy Chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia at the helm. "Sonia Gandhi wants a politician heading finance, specially since we are heading for elections soon," says a Cabinet minister. The favourite remains Home Minister P. Chidambaram, who, however, is hobbled by court cases. Along with Subramanian Swamy's appeal pending against the trial court verdict exonerating him in the 2G case, there is another case pending against his 2009

He may not have been a great success as finance minister, but he certainly deserved the post of prime minister. If he wins the presidential election and enters Rashtrapati Bhavan, that will be some consolation for a long career in politics.

Mukherjee has been the perennial number two, ever since Indira Gandhi gave him that role in 1980, bypassing such stalwarts in her Cabinet as R. Venkataraman, N.D. Tiwari, Giani Zail Singh and P.V. Narasimha Rao. Manmohan's choice seems to be limited between Antony and Chidambaram, with the odds favouring the former. But Congressmen recall that Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth had sent a note dated October 22, 2011, stating that "either the minister of finance or the minister of home affairs may remain in Delhi during the period of the

election in a Madurai court. This has encouraged younger ministers with more hope than chance to start lobbying very publicly. Commerce Minister Anand Sharma and Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh have launched a war to damage each other. Never has the paucity of talent in Congress been felt so glaringly than in the search to fill the Mukherjee void. Who has the stature to be leader of the House? As Sonia Gandhi told a Congress MP recently, "Who do we have left? Our seniormost person (after Mukherjee) is Kamal Nath." Nath is an eight-term MP but, according to a Congress MP, is not too keen to take up the job since he understands the price of failure. According to Congress sources, Sonia seems to have settled on Power Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, a trusted family loyalist. However, a Congress general secretary points out that this would mean promoting two Dalits in the Lok Sabha, since the Speaker, Meira Kumar, is also Dalit. The other choice before Sonia is S. Jaipal Reddy. An itinerant politician, Reddy will find it difficult to impose his will on Congress colleagues, let alone the Opposition. Pawan Bansal, the current parliamentary affairs minister, is a lightweight. This fact was effectively disguised by Mukherjee's presence. Whether it was the fracas over the Lokpal or women's reservation bills, all parliamentary crises were resolved in Mukherjee's Room No. 13 in Parliament, not in Bansal's chambers. In a Government of well-coiffeured lightweights, Mukherjee was the one troubleshooter who could steer the ship of state. Defence Minister A.K. Antony is known more for plodding than political strategy. Ghulam Nabi Azad has experience but he seems to be losing his touch, having recently bungled in Andhra Pradesh both in the handling of Telangana and Jagan Mohan Reddy, losing a party fortress in the process. Others such as Kapil Sibal and Salman Khurshid are political novices who have not quite outgrown the St Stephen's Shakespeare Society. Manmohan also needs to pinpoint a number two, the minister who will chair Cabinet meetings in his absence.

Prime Minister's absence" on the eve of the Manmohan's tours to France, Maldives and Singapore in November that year. "This effectively put Chidambaram above Antony in the Prime Minister's pecking order," says a Cabinet minister. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders point towards their chief, Sharad Pawar. He is the most senior after Mukherjee but belongs to the wrong party. Manmohan could lean on Pawar for fence-mending with the allies. Manmohan's equation with Pawar dates back to 1991 when the latter supported the then finance minister's policies of liberalisation. Even today, Manmohan is more comfortable with Pawar than with most of his Congress Cabinet colleagues. "No one person can replace Pranab as troubleshooter. There will be different people used, depending on the nature of the crises," says a party spokesman. He points to Nath's equation with allies such as Mamata Banerjee and M. Karunanidhi. Managing the Left would probably be Vayalar Ravi's job, while Rajeev Shukla could play a more active role in floor management in Parliament. But the problem is obvious: Ten hands will be needed where two served before. Disarray and confusion are almost inevitable. None of them has Mukherjee's sleight of hand. BJP leader Yashwant Sinha recalls how Mukherjee got his party on board to pass the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill (PFRDA) during the winter session of Parliament in 2011. Mukherjee had invited L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Sinha to his office to discuss PFRDA. Says Sinha, "We told him that we were ready to give up our opposition to the bill in its existing form if the Government agreed to our proposals on assured returns and placing a 26 per cent FDI cap in pension fund management companies through the Act. He not only accepted our demands, but also summoned a joint secretary immediately to sit with me to weave in the necessary changes in the bill." Adds Sinha, "The fact that he was prepared to concede ground on merit facilitated his task of hammering

In 2007, Pranab Mukherjee discreetly expressed his desire to move to Rashtrapati Bhavan. The Left leaders took his brief to Congress President Sonia Gandhi. One night, Mukherjee received urgent summons from her. Sonia convinced Mukherjee that she was not opposed to his candidature. Then, after a pause, she said, smiling, "You will have to do me a favour. Just tell me, who can replace you in the Cabinet and perform your role? Give me a name and you will be our candidate." Mukherjee sat dumbfounded for a while and then broke into laughter. Sonia, too, joined in. scriptures contain references to drunken behaviour by gods, by rattling the relevant shlokas one after another. Later, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told Mukherjee, "I have warned Dr (Murli Manohar) Joshi, he should not take punga with you in religious matters. He does not know you can recite the entire Chandi Path from memory." At one of the meetings of the P.V. Narasimha Rao government, Mukherjee rejected then agriculture minister Balram Jakhar's proposals on the fixing of remunerative prices for farmers and asked him to read his detailed notes on a file he wrote 20 years ago. Then, to everyone's bewilderment, Mukherjee recalled from memory virtually every word he had written on the file. The meeting over, Rao called Mukherjee aside and whispered into his ear, "Why on earth do you take the trouble of remembering so much? Didn't Rajiv throw you out from the party?"

Notes to myself
Daughter Sharmistha says it's extremely difficult to squeeze money out of Pranab Mukherjee: "It would start with an outrageous demand on my part, and after a long process of cajoling, coaxing, threatening, bargaining and negotiation, we would arrive at a mutually agreeable sum, usually 4-5 per cent of the original demand. After it had been given, and pocketed, he would let out a pathetic sigh and declare in Bengali, affectionately, `You are a chor, daku, shashtrapani--a lethal combination of thief, robber and armed gangster'." Once in Kolkata, Mukherjee went with a Congressman to a party colleague's wedding. With most shops having closed by the time they landed, the Congressman suggested that they buy a gift from his wife's boutique. With prices ranging from Rs 1,000Rs 20,000, pat came Mukherjee's advice, "Go for Rs 1,000."

out a consensus on crucial issues." Unlike some of his ministerial colleagues, Mukherjee was loath to be confrontationist. "Persuasion was his most potent weapon. He would give in readily if he found the argument convincing. This explains why Manmohan Singh fielded him on most occasions to break logjams, in Parliament or outside," says Rajya Sabha member and NCP leader D.P. Tripathi. Privately, BJP leaders say that had the Congress made an effort in building a consensus around Mukherjee's name before announcing it, they would have seriously considered supporting the Congress leader. Perhaps it is this cross-party goodwill that makes Sonia worry that Mukherjee's ear will be open to advice from quarters other than 10 Janpath when he becomes president. Pawar, Karunanidhi, Ajit

Singh and even Mulayam Singh Yadav pressurised the Congress into naming Mukherjee by asking for a political candidate with stature. "You will see when he becomes president, he will overtake even APJ Abdul Kalam as the People's President," says Pradyut Guha, a former Youth Congress president from

West Bengal who was Mukherjee's additional PS in the finance ministry and is now his campaign manager. The most interesting equation is the one that Mukherjee shares with the Left. During UPA 1, he had to keep them in good humour and yet pass the legislation needed for the nuclear deal, on

which the Left had taken a principled, albeit unpopular, stand. Relations between the comrades and Mukherjee went sour. Says former CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan, "During the discussions on the nuclear deal, Mukherjee, who had been named as the convener of the UPA-Left Coordination

Committee to iron out differences, sought our consent to go to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to sign an India-specific safeguards agreement. He assured us that no further step on the nuclear deal will be taken without our go-ahead. But once the government went to IAEA, the nuclear deal was on auto pilot." He added bitterly, "Mr Mukherjee had been consistently giving us fake, token assurances." This bitterness was apparent when CPI refused to back Mukherjee's candidature for president. The CPI(M) politburo was split on supporting him but Mukherjee got the party's vote, just as he did in 1993 when he needed a few cross votes to ensure his Rajya Sabha election from West Bengal. Back then, when he had asked Jyoti Basu for help, the latter told him bluntly that CPI(M) would never vote for a Congressman. That was the official line. Unofficially, Mukherjee managed his seat.

Muniyappa, who is not normally known for his powers of observation, hit the nail on the head when he called Mukherjee "the Chanakya of the UPA Government" in Parliament in May this year. Muniyappa was lobbying for more funds for railways but his comment drew a smile from both Mukherjee and Sonia who were present in the House at the time. Mukherjee headed 15 of the 27 GoMs, and all but one of the Empowered GoMs. Between UPA 1 and 2, he has chaired around 85 GoMs. The areas covered by them ranged from issues as diverse as spectrum pricing, ultra mega power projects, mass rapid transport system policy and price band of shares held by the Government in PSUs.

Persuasion was his most potent weapon. He would give in readily if he found the argument convincing. This explains why Dr Singh fielded him most to break logjams.

Mukherjee's short temper, often displayed in the House, has only added to the legend. A DMK leader recalls how during UPA 1, at a GOM on fuel prices, A. Raja had accompanied M.K. Alagiri because he felt the latter needed a translator. Mukherjee tartly asked him to leave stating that if Alagiri needed an interpreter for English, they would provide him one. He reduced then rail minister Mamata Banerjee to tears when she came up with a lastminute demand for 24 projects for the 2010 Rail Budget. He cleared them, telling her, "I will not give you the chance to go out and claim that I have not approved projects for Bengal," but also added that she would have to find the funds for these herself. Another memorable outburst was during the recently concluded Parliament session when he shouted at the Opposition for demanding a probe against Chidambaram over allegations that his son Karti had profited from a telecom deal in 2006. Recalls Sinha, "He lost his cool and yelled--shut up or get out. The House plunged into turmoil, and the Speaker had to adjourn its proceedings. Accompanied by Parliamentary Affairs Minister P.K. Bansal, Mukherjee walked up to me and apologised for his outburst. I told him to do so when the House reassembled. He duly obliged." After Mukherjee expressed his regret, Lalu Prasad Yadav got up and said, "Pranabda has a right to admonish. His intention is never bad." Mukherjee himself is aware of his short temper. Last December, when the Prime Minister gave him the first K. Karunakaran Best Administrator Award, Mukherjee smiled ruefully and thanked him for his support "despite my short temper". The 76-year-old Pranab Mukherjee's heroes are Jawaharhal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi; but his greatest admiration is for Indira Gandhi. As he told INDIA TODAY in a recent interview, "I have read almost every speech of Nehru's. He made every effort to build the country and take it forward." So strong is his sense of history that when he rejoined North Block as finance minister in 2009, one of the first things he asked for was the oak table that had

been used by Liaquat Ali Khan, India's finance minister in the interim government prior to Independence. Mukherjee had used this table when he was finance minister earlier between 1982 and 1984 and was keen to use it again. Finally the missing table was found, not without effort, in a ground floor corner room in North Block. It was not in a condition to be used. President Pranab Mukherjee will offer a sharp contrast to the bland Pratibha Patil. The one reason why Mukherjee has such cross-party support is that he is no rubber stamp. Defining his new role, Mukherjee had said, "If I am elected president, a new era would start for me, after nearly four decades in politics. For the president, there is neither politics nor any party; he acts according to the Constitution." The next presidency will be an important one. If the next General Elections, slated for 2014, throw up a

hung House, it will be up to the next president to judge which party has the numbers to form the government. Moreover, when Mukherjee travels abroad he will not be a novice like Patil. He has been external affairs minister twice, once from 1995 to 1996, and later on from 2006 to 2009. Kartik Adhikari, a Kolkata-based professor and friend of Mukherjee, once told the media that in 1980-81 when the two were dining together at a friend's place in Alipore, Mukherjee got a call from then prime minister Indira Gandhi. She had just met then US president Ronald Reagan and wanted to consult Mukherjee about it. Later, in October 2010, just before President Barack Obama's India visit, it was Mukherjee who went to Washington to sort out the details. The only holiday Mukherjee takes is a four-day break during Durga Puja every year. He once joked with Manmohan that the Government should put all crises on hold during puja. Mukherjee has been walking the extra mile since he was a boy who had to walk 10 km everyday to his village school. As he told INDIA TODAY, "There was no road, I walked through paddy fields. That is how I get my energy." He had then added, "I wish I had some time to relax. Even now, before I go to bed I read for 20 minutes to half an hour. More often than not, I sleep with the lights on. Someone has to come and switch off the lights." The national spotlight has found its logical place: Firmly on the presidential hopeful. Once when asked about his height-- 5 ft 2 inches--he smiled and said, "I am happy at the height where destiny has put me." Manmohan's Cabinet has just lost its tallest leader, and the nation will gain one in Rashtrapati Bhavan.
