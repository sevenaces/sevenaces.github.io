CANDID CAMERA
Kareena Kapoor has an army of fans. You can now add another, a triggerhappy one, actor Imran Khan. So captivated was he by his Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu co-star that he took photographs of her on his phone while shooting. Now he plans to hold an exhibition of 20 select pictures at a Mumbai art gallery. Says Khan, "I feel I have clicked some very nice pictures of hers. Karan (Johar, the film's producer) thought it will be a good idea to have an exhibition of the photographs." We wonder what another Khan, Kapoor's significant other, will say.

KAREENA KAPOOR

Old Star Turns
Pankaj Kapur and Shabana Azmi
The two were last seen together in Ek Doctor Ki Maut (1992). Vishal Bhardwaj brings Kapur and Azmi together as a couple in his comedy film Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola which has Imran Khan and Anushka Sharma in the lead.

Jeetendra and Hema Malini
One-time couple Jeetendra and Hema Malini were last thrown together in 1992 when she directed him in Dil Aashna Hai. Now they star in a mythological film Barbareek, although separately. While Malini is seen as Bhim's wife Hidamba, Jeetendra is a bhakt who appears in the film for two songs.

Like Father, Like Son
He assisted Karan Johar on My Name Is Khan and Main Hoon Na. So there was nothing to suggest that Karan Malhotra would make an uber-violent film like Agneepath, and that too for the king of candy floss, Karan Johar. But then Malhotra is the son of yesteryear producer Ravi, who worked with Rishi Kapoor on four films, including Khel Khel Mein (1975) and Prem Rog (1982). Filmmaking is in his DNA.
