CANDY GIRL
There is something quite familiar about Russian-Australian model Kristina Akheeva, 25.She has done the requisite commercials for bags, shampoos,clothes and deodorants, but more recently,managed to pass herself off as Shahid Kapoor's arm candy.The trick worked,as she bagged her first film soon after and even became showstopper at a jewellery fashion week.She will act opposite Sunny Deol for the sequel to the Deol bonanza, Yamla Pagla Deewana.Not a bad start,but can she really keep the momentum?

ITEM CHARM
Neha Dhupia, 31, has tremendous potential as an item girl, and given her mostly miserable film graph, it's a surprise she didn't jump onto the stage in a tiny blouse right at the start. We are glad she is doing so now for Tigmanshu Dhulia's sequel to Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster, in a number composed by Sandeep Chowta. It will not be a surprise if this gets her more appreciation than all her films put together.

DHARMENDRA WITH HEMA MALINI

Mr & Mrs Congeniality
Hema Malini can spout reams of praise about Dharmendra at any time of the day,but the couple is rarely seen with each other.Television reality show, Indian Idol 6, has changed all that by bringing them together as guest judges.The last time we saw them in the same frame was at daughter Esha Deol's wedding,where she looked a tad disapproving because he was busy working himself into a rage. Good to see them more congenial.
