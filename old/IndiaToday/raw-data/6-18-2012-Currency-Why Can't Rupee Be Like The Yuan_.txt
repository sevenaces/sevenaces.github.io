CURRENCY
According to experts, it may still be a while before the yuan evolves into a global currency. Says economist Bibek Debroy, "The dollar is the world's reserve currency not just because of its use in trade, but also because people invest in US dollar-denominated financial assets like bonds and treasury securities. China has not opened its financial markets yet, limiting the yuan to trade-related purposes." Debroy only expects the yuan to become a global currency 20 years from now, at the earliest. For now, China may have the more limited ambition of becoming an acceptable regional currency. A senior Chinese economist, Xing Yuqing, working at the Asian Development Bank told Xinhua on June 2: "Before the Chinese yuan becomes an international currency, it should be a regional currency." The rupee cannot even aspire for regional currency status. Says Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist and senior vice-president of Axis Bank, "I can't imagine what Japan would do with rupees other than send them back to India as aid." The rupee has lost 20 per cent of its value in the last year. Given that track record, nobody would want rupees in their foreign exchange reserves. "The earliest that the rupee would be in consideration for global currency status is 40 years," says Debroy. "If the UPA remains in power for long, it may take a much longer time," he adds. The decline in the rupee over the last one year is a reflection of the Government's poor economic management. Foreign investors have signalled no confidence in the Indian economy. The rupee has borne the brunt of their anger. It was just under two years ago, in July 2010, that the Government adopted a symbol for the rupee. At the time, the move to adopt a symbol was viewed as a first step to internationalising the currency. Since then, the rupee has lost 20 per cent of its value, from around Rs 46.50 to a dollar to Rs 55.60 to a dollar. In 2010, the Government had the rupee all dressed up. Now, it has nowhere to go.

WHYCAN'TRUPEE BE LIKE THE YUAN?
China's currency goes global as euro and dollar struggle. The rupee sinks, doomed by economic mismanagement.

O

n the morning of June 1, China took a major step to extend its growing global economic clout by commencing direct trade of its currency, the yuan, with the Japanese yen. In Mumbai, on the same day, the Reserve Bank of India continued its desperate efforts to shore up a sinking rupee, achieving marginal success. The rupee appreciated from Rs 56.10 to a dollar on May 31 to Rs 55.60 on June 1. Even as China inched closer to its goal of making the yuan a credible international currency, India's dream of becoming an economic superpower continued to drift away. From June 1, China's trade with Japan--its second largest trading partner after the United States--will be settled only in yuan and yen without the need for American dollars. Until June 1, 60 per cent of ChinaJapan trade worth around $300 billion annually was conducted using US dollars. The move to direct trading in yuan-yen will save both countries the transaction costs of converting currency to dollars. It will boost bilateral trade and investment. On June 2, China's government controlled press agency, Xinhua, noted its most important implication: "The move also marks another step to raise the yuan's international role." A wire report from American news agency Bloomberg on the same day was more explicit, calling it "another step in its (China's) efforts to expand the global use of its currency and re-

duce reliance on dollar". China's move is well-timed. With the Eurozone in deep crisis and Japan in stagnation for two decades, the US dollar is the only genuinely acceptable currency in the world. There is room for an alternative. China is in a vastly superior position to India. The strength of a currency is ultimately determined by the robustness of its economy. China is the second largest economy in the world with a GDP of $7.2 trillion, four times the size of India's $1.7 trillion economy. It is also the fastest growing economy in the world with a growth rate of 8 per cent, much faster than India's sub-6 per cent growth. China runs a current account surplus, because its exports far exceed imports. That strengthens the yuan. India runs a huge current account deficit which is financed by uncertain foreign capital inflows. That makes the rupee vulnerable. However, China's GDP is still half the size of the $15 trillion US economy. But the US, which has struggled to generate significant economic growth in four years, is on shaky foundations. The economy grew at 1.9 per cent in the first three months of 2012, which is its recovery phase after the 2008-09 global financial crisis. China, among other nations, is concerned that the United States will allow the dollar to depreciate to boost its exports and growth. But so far, in the absence of alternatives, countries continue to hold foreign exchange reserves in dollar. Even China has $3.3 trillion in its foreign exchange reserves.
