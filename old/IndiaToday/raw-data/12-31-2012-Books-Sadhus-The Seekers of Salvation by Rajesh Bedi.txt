arshuram Das has been standing in one posture for the past 12 years, his feet swollen from bearing his weight. Khadeshwari Baba from Ayodhya has sworn celibacy for 12 years, wearing an iron loincloth, his manhood locked for life. Leela Bhandari's calm face does not reveal her poignant back story, of an 18-year-old who gave up on the worldly way of life when her father died, ignoring the entreaties of her family. Sadhus: The Seekers of Salvation looks oriental enough to impress the Western collector of exotic relics. But renowned

wildlife photographer Rajesh Bedi's extraordinary photographs of ascetics, embellished with father Ramesh Bedi's detailed text, offer an insight into a world which is in turns gruesome, awesome, and eye-poppingly original. The sight of an aghori tearing the rotting flesh off a skull, or a half decomposed corpse afloat in its green watery grave, or an ascetic rolling his penis and extending it on a stick to the posterior of his body, or even a sadhu's fingernails grown to hideously long proportions. All of Rajesh Bedi's photographs are as riveting as they are wince-inducing. But his camera doesn't shy away from any of it. It stares bravely at the face of an aghori who

NAGA SADHUS, ENDLESSLY CHANTING SHIVA'S NAME, HUDDLE AROUND A FIRE ON A FREEZING WINTER NIGHT

has completed a 41-day penance of silence, and captures the tear slipping down the face. It doesn't flinch from a woman ascetic who meditates by the pyre where the foot of a stillburning body protrudes. It refuses to look away from a naked sadhu whose cracked heels are being administered to with candle wax by a devotee to prevent bleeding. It stares right back into the angry face of a sadhu who is about to turn on the camera in anger at being filmed. These are unflinching portraits of a world of privation, of despair, and of faith. There are also more familiar ones--of sadhus taking a holy dip during the Kumbh Mela, of a Naga sadhu mugging for the camera in an approximation of Shiva's celestial dance, of the mass of humanity that follows the procession of a well regarded swami (in this case Swami Avadeshanand lead-

ing a contingent of the Juna Akhada), and of a sadhu engrossed in his chillum. In the flight of a naked Naga sadhu, in the water dripping from a sadhu's hands while performing jal arpan, and in the raised palms of a female sadhu at first morning light, the camera finds an arc that connects our deepest fears with our most inchoate beliefs. What if we had so little on earth and yet aspired to so much in afterlife? Rajesh sought to pay a tribute to his late father who spent a lifetime working at the Gurukul Kangri University near Haridwar. His text provides a valuable accompaniment to a world of loneliness and quietude, on the margins of materialism, where a man who forsakes worldly pleasure is regarded as a freak and another who revels in it is considered a respectable hedonist. The book charts the often traumatic journey from home to hermitage and perhaps some of the most soulful pictures are of the sadhus caught in their travels: Sometimes resting, with their handful of belongings by the side of a road (a steel balti, a lota, a katori, a box of matches, a handful of wood, and on his body, just a loincloth made of banana plant). And at other times, passing through a narrow Nashik street atop a jeep on their way to a royal bath started as a tradition by Peshwa rulers of the Deccan in the 18th century to prevent battles between Vaishnavite and Shaivite sects. Nothing in India, or indeed in this book, ever lacks drama.
