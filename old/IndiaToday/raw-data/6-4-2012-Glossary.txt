GLOSSARY
MODEST DEBUT
Amitabh Bachchan, 69, will make his Hollywood debut this December. He will be seen in Australian filmmaker Baz Luhrmann's big-screen adaptation of the novel The Great Gatsby by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. Bachchan plays the character of Meyer Wolfsheim and shares screen space with actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. Big B admitted to playing a small role in the film in his blog.

COOL LADIES AT THE CROISETTE
This year saw the largest Indian turnout ever at Cannes. While filmmakers busied themselves with getting their films as much attention as possible, the women did their bit by flaunting pretty clothes on the red carpet.

Kriti Malhotra
chose a slinky, shimmery black gown with a long slit for the screening of Peddlers, where she plays one of the three protagonists-- a Bangladeshi immigrant, Bilkis Bano.A good thing too that she managed to grab eyeballs before the screening, because afterwards, it was Siddharth Diwan and his cinematography that stole the show.

Huma Qureshi has been generating a lot of curiosity ever since she landed a role in Anurag Kashyap's Gangs Of Wasseypur. The first-timer at Cannes ensured that the attention stayed on her. She chose to go traditional amid the fanfare of gowns, attending the film's photocall in a black and gold anarkali by Varun Bahl. Nimrat Kaur has a relatively
small role in Peddlers, where she plays a married neighbour having an affair with Gulshan Devaiah's character, a Narcotics Bureau cop. She made up for lack of screen time by being fairly visible at Cannes in a gold sari with a bright blouse, which she followed up with an eye-popping bright pink gown.

Freida Pinto made quite a fashion
statement with her carefully selected wardrobe, as she turned up for the premiere of Moonrise Kingdom during the festival's opening ceremony and subsequent parties. First, a pink Michael Angel gown, then a lacy lime green Atelier Versace dress with a thigh-high slit. She even got the white and gold Paco Rabanne dress right, other than the flash of underwear, as she stepped out for a party.

LOSING BATTLE
Looks like Priyanka Chopra's cousin, Meera Chopra, 29, a popular face in Telugu and Tamil films, is a victim of the cold war between Vivek Oberoi and Salman Khan. Her friendship with Khan has cost her the lead role in Soham Shah's film Sher, opposite Oberoi. Meanwhile, Nargis Fakhri, 32, also lost out on the lead role opposite Akshay Kumar in Khiladi 786--because the producers wanted an actor who would look like Mithun Chakraborty's sister in the film.

What's new The overdone love triangle set in London may remind you of Love Aaj Kal. Watching Penty as Meera, a desi girl with values, doesn't look promising enough, nor does Pritam's composition of Tumhi ho bandhu, sakha tumhi ho.

It will have her son Tanuj Virwani, 25, in the lead, done by Hassan in the original. The leading lady is still being sought. Virwani made his debut with Joe Rajan's Luv U Soniyo, which released in 2011. Can he reinvent the magic again?
