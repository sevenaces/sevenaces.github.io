he global automobile industry is not daunted by the recent slowdown in India's growth rate. The 11th edition of AutoExpo, which begins in Delhi on January 7, will launch more than 50 new models of cars and other vehicles, marginally higher than the number launched at the 10th edition in 2010. Motor enthusiasts will be able to view more than 200 car models including the new launches at Delhi's Pragati Maidan, across different price segments. The show-stealer in the premium segment is the super luxury convertible SLS Roadster by Mercedes, priced at Rs 2.5 crore. Luxury carmakers BMW and Audi will present their latest concept cars to the Indian audience. At the opposite end of the price spectrum, Bajaj's new small car, the RE60, launched three days before the AutoExpo, will attract a lot of attention. It isn't clear yet whether the small car which the company claims will give a mileage of 35 km to a litre will be available to all consumers or restricted for use as public transport, much like Bajaj's best-selling threewheeler autorickshaws. 2012 seems to be the year for utility vehicles. Mahindra & Mahindra will launch its sports utility vehicles, SsangYong Korando and SsangYong Rexton; Maruti will showcase its multiutility vehicle Ertiga; and Nissan will bring to India its NV200. Renault's mid-price SUV, Duster, and Volkswagen's upgraded Touareg will also be on display at the AutoExpo. The rise in prices of petrol through 2011 has made cars that run on diesel attractive buys for the price-conscious Indian consumer. The price differential between petrol and diesel is a sizeable Rs 25 per litre. Most

AUTO BILD'S BUDGET PICKS FOR 2012
First car? Or scared of large instalments on that auto loan? These cars are no compromise, with techspecs that are spot on. Chevrolet Sail
Engine 1.2-litre petrol Launch Second half of 2012 Features Sail will replace the aging Aveo UV-A recent report that it expects the automobile sector to rebound after cuts in interest rates. "We believe fiscal year 2013 may not mimic a Vshaped recovery, as we expect modest near-11 to 13 per cent growth in the auto sector," the report says Bankers are hopeful that interest rates will indeed decline this year after the RBI signalled a pause in its rate hikes in its December review of monetary policy. Says Rana Kapoor, managing director and CEO of Yes Bank, "I expect interest rates to come down 1.5 per cent by September." The year has started on an ominous note for consumers. Major car manufacturers like Mahindra & Mahindra, Hyundai Motor India, Toyota Kirloskar, Ford India, Nissan and General Motors India have begun the year with price hikes in the range of 1-3 per cent. The pressure of inflation and the sharp decline in the rupee have added to cost pressures, some of which are inevitably being passed on to consumers. Nevertheless, those who have deferred purchases through 2011 would be looking to buy more cars in 2012. Balendran expects the market to turn around by April-May. He is not upbeat about growth in the small car segment. "The small car segment has not grown much, the major growth has happened in the premium hatchback section. The low-medium has also registered some growth but the mini car has been a dampener this year," he points out. Unlike in 2010, when manufacturers had pinned their hopes on small cars, in 2012, they are focusing on the premium and mid-price segments to drive the market. These segments are usually less sensitive to high inflation and prohibitive interest rates than the budget segment.

The outlook is bleak. India Inc expects the first three months of 2012 to be worse than the last three months of 2011.
ndia Inc expects the quarter between January and March 2012 to be worse for business prospects than the dismal quarter between October and December 2011. The fourth edition of the BUSINESS TODAYCfore Business Confidence Survey, conducted among 500 CEOs and CFOs in 12 Indian cities, has revealed the continuous decline in business confidence through the four quarters of 2011. There are few signs of an immediate turnaround. The last four months of 2011 witnessed a sharp decline in key eco-

July and September. The outlook for the first three months of 2012 is bleak. Seventythree per cent of those surveyed said they expect the economic situation to be worse between January and March than between October and December. A huge majority of 83 per cent said that the outlook for investments in the January-March quarter is worse than in the October-December quarter. The pessimism of India Inc, which cuts across, big, medium, small and micro enterprises, is bad news for the Government which is still hopeful of

of the new SUVs run on diesel, but there are also a number of smaller cars that are looking to make a mark in this segment. Tata Motors is releasing a diesel variant of the Nano in a bid to compensate for the lukewarm sales of its petrol version. Other companies are also eyeing the segment. General Motors Vice-President P. Balendran told INDIA TODAY that while the company saw little growth in 2011, it recorded good sales growth for the diesel variant of the Chevrolet Beat. Going with the green theme of the event, visitors can also see a number of

cars that run on alternate fuel. Maruti and Tata, among others, will launch hybrid models. Mahindra is expected to launch an upgraded version of its electric car Reva, the Reva NXR. Car makers are hoping that the expo will herald a turnaround after a bad year in 2011. It is estimated that the sector grew by about 3 per cent in 2011, compared with a growth of 30.8 per cent in 2010. The purchasing power of Indian consumers was dented by a combination of high inflation, prohibitive interest rates and increased cost of petrol. R.C. Bhargava, chairman

of India's largest car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki, believes that 2012 will be better for car makers. Says Bhargava, "Historically, one bad year is followed by a good year." However, he doesn't expect a return to 2010. "I don't think 2012 will see a growth of 25 per cent," he says, reflecting the general mood of cautious optimism among car manufacturers. Few expect the headwinds of high interest rates, high inflation and high fuel prices to go away in just one year. There will be a moderation of adverse conditions. Broking firm ICICI Direct said in a

nomic indicators. The Index of Industrial Production declined by 5.1 per cent in October, recording its lowest level in 28 months. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) hiked interest rates for the 13th time since March 2010 in its protracted fight against inflation in October 2011. The rupee declined by 20 per cent between September and December, leading to a sharp rise in input costs for many firms. Sixty-eight per cent of respondents in the survey said that economic conditions were either moderately or substantially worse in the October-December quarter than in the July-September quarter. Sixty-nine per cent of respondents said that the availability of business finance was worse between October and December than it was between

recording a 7.5 per cent economic growth in 2011-12. That is looking increasingly unlikely as economic conditions for the last 6 months of the financial year seem to be substantially worse than for the first six months when growth averaged just 7.3 per cent. In fact, growth in the relatively better quarter of July-September 2011 was just 6.9 per cent. It is unlikely that the RBI will cut interest rates before the end of the financial year in March as inflation is still hovering close to double digits. The earliest respite may come only in the next financial year when interest rates begin to fall. In the interim, India Inc will hope that the Government can overcome its policy paralysis.
