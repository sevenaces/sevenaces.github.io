DESI GHEE MOMS

T

he Haryana government, headed by its avidly health-conscious Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, has endorsed a rather unusual proposal. Henceforth, mothers of newborn babies will be eligible for a one-time gift of a kilo . State health of `pure desi ghee' authorities, who are supervising the implementation of the Surakshit Maa Awards scheme, say the gift would be waiting when the mums bring their infants to government hospitals for post-birth check-ups. It's designed to tackle the problem of post-delivery anaemia, particularly amid young women from villages. Those who don't want ghee will get utensils worth Rs 300.

PRESENT, SIR
he biometric attendance machine at the Union finance ministry, mostly out of order for the past three years, has started functioning again. Just in time for new minister P. Chidambaram to check on his officials, and ensure they work as long hours as he does. If presence in office was synonymous with productivity, we would be a delighted nation. However, at least the babus will be in office now.

KHURSHID

enior BJP leader L.K. Advani called up Congress leader Salman Khurshid to wish him on Eid. In response to Advani's wishes, Khurshid said he would send some sewaiyan made with artificial sweetener to his home. A laughing Advani told him that he preferred sewaiyan with sugar. Can't blame Khurshid: Most other BJP leaders are diabetic.

DIVIDE AND DROOL
othing succeeds quite like co-option. On August 18, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi facilitated the appointment of Vipul Chaudhary as chairman of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF). Chaudhary, 45, will now be the custodian of the Amul brand name. Chaudhary had organised the 1995 rebellion of BJP MLAs for his then boss, Shankarsinh Vaghela, against then chief minister Keshubhai Patel. Patel, of CHAUDHARY course, is now Modi's nemesis, hence the reward for Chaudhary."I am thankful to the Gujarat government for guiding me,'' said Chaudhary, who as chairman of the Dudh Sagar Dairy, one of the 16 district milk unions comprising GCMMF, launched a new packaged milk brand that lasts for three months. Longer than some political careers.

PREMIER PARTY
JP leader Shahnawaz Hussain could not contain his excitement when he got to know that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would attend his Eid lunch on August 20.As soon as the SPG informed Hussain that the Prime Minister would come at 1.15 p.m. sharp and stay for 15 minutes, he started calling up the other invitees, including his own senior party colleagues, asking them to come by 1 p.m. to prevent any confusion when Manmohan arrived. After the Prime Minister's exit from Hussain's home at 7, Pandit Pant Marg, the BJP leader could not wipe the grin off his face.Are you sure you're in the right party, Mr Hussain?

he Intelligence Bureau (IB), which should be gathering information on anti-national elements, has been busy keeping tabs on one of its former directors, Ajit Doval, and Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF), of which he is a director. Based on IB reports, the UPA Government is spreading the word that Doval and his team at VIF, which include prominent RSS ideologues, are the brain behind the anti-corruption movement in the country, especially the one led by Baba Ramdev. It was in April 2011 that VIF organised a seminar on corruption and black money. Soon after, Anna Hazare's fast began and Ramdev announced his June 4 Ramlila Maidan protest. IB men have since been keeping a keen eye on VIF. Doval, who has had some experience at spotting IB men, finds the situation mildly amusing.

THE POSTER SHOWING CM GEHLOT AS A PEACOCK

PREEN LIKE A PEACOCK
inally Ashok Gehlot has something to preen about. Rains have made a late but impressive entry into Rajasthan and the Congress is celebrating with posters that show the Chief Minister as a peacock and his predecessor, Vasundhara Raje, as a soaked bird carrying an umbrella. The slogan said: "Ashok ke raj mein kisko shok (Who is mourning in Ashok's rule)?" Rain wars are not new to the state. In 2010, when rain finally graced the state in July, Gehlot had gone to the US for a meeting of Rajasthan Association of North America. The BJP had then sent SMSs saying: "Gehlot gaye videsh, barish aye desh (Rains come to the state after Gehlot leaves for the US)."

GREEK TO GEHLOT
s elections near, Ashok Gehlot has discovered the joys of social media. On August 20, he declared that he would be writing a regular blog on the newly launched website of the Pradesh Congress Committee. We hope he blogs better than he tweets. He launched his Twitter account on October 6, 2011, and has tweeted only five times since--including three to mourn the deaths of ghazal maestro Jagjit Singh and Apple founder Steve Jobs. Was Steve Gehlot's pal?
