Netaji Lives,On Record
Kolhapur resident to play rare Subhas Chandra Bose speech during the Ganesh festival to inspire youth
round 15 years ago, Srikrishna Kalgaonkar, 68, a retired professor of pure mathematics from Kolhapur, Maharashtra, had gone to visit a friend's wada (a large, traditional house) at the village Kasba Bawda to collect old gramophone records that would take his collection to 4,500. Among the dustcovered vinyls was a recording of a speech by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, recorded by Young India Company at a time the chief of the Indian National Army (INA) was still an active leader of the Indian National Congress (INC). Determined to introduce the great nationalist leader's legacy to the youth, Kalgaonkar is all set to play the record at several public places during the 10-day Ganesh festival beginning September 19 in his hometown. In his five minute speech in Hindi, Bose had appealed to India's youth to unite and fight against British rule. The record that holds Bose's speech carries his printed signature in green, but does not say when the speech was recorded. One can only assume that it was before the formation of INA, as Bose is heard appealing to the youth to join the Congress. Bose's voice on the 72 rpm (rotation per minute) record is still loud and clear. "I am sure Netaji's voice would excite youngsters," says Kalgaonkar. He admits that the discovery of a rare audio clip of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak in Pune in August inspired him to play Bose's record at public places. "Though I have not studied Bose thoroughly, the record of his speech has a special place in my heart. I take a lot of time to clean it every day," Kalgaonkar told INDIA

A

TODAY. He is not sure whether the record is a rare one. "Young India Company (run by late film producerdirector V. Shantaram) had shut down many decades ago. I have no idea whether any collector possesses another copy." An enthusiastic collector, Kalgaonkar is a proud owner of 61 gramophone players and a diehard fan of music director Naushad. "I have discs of 58 of Naushad's films," he proclaims, adding that Naushad

arun Gogoi is ready to undermine his own achievements over the last 11 years as Chief Minister of Assam. In a recent TV interview, he said Muslims outnumbered Hindus in the state not because of illegal Bangladeshi immigration, but because they were illiterate and as a result bore more children. "Most Muslims are illiterate. Every family has six to 10 children," said Gogoi. By saying so, he underplayed his own government's progress in stepping up literacy rates in Muslimmajority districts of Assam. For instance, the literacy rate of Hailakandi, with the third highest Muslim population--57.6 per cent according to the 2001 Census--rose from 59.64 per cent in 2001 to 75.26 per cent in 2011. This is higher than Assam's average of 73.18 per cent. But Hailakandi's decadal population growth rate also rose to 21.44 per cent in 2011, higher than the 20.89 per cent it recorded in 2001. Even in Dhubri, with highest percentage of Muslims (74.3 per cent), literacy has gone up from 48.17 per cent in 2001 to 59.17 per cent in 2011. In fact, decadal population growth rate rose in the top

T

three Muslim-majority districts, despite improvement in literacy rates (see table). On the other hand, with a Muslim population of just 1.8 per cent, Dhemaji, at 20.30 per cent, is a high seventh in population growth rate. Gogoi may have mocked groups demanding deportation of Bangladeshi infiltrators, but Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde admitted cross-border infiltration was still on. "We've taken steps to stop it, but it's still on," he said on September 10, contradicting Gogoi's take. Gogoi received flak from all corners as a result. "I'm shocked. It's unbecoming of a Chief Minister. No doubt illiteracy is high among Muslims, but to

single them out for population growth is unfair. It's the state's duty to spread education and improve living conditions of the underprivileged. He must concentrate on that, instead of making such statements," said Rajinder Sachar, former chief justice of the Delhi High Court, who headed the committee that prepared the landmark report on soco-economic conditions of Muslims in India. Justice Sachar, however, refused to comment if illegal immigration led to high growth rates in the Muslimmajority districts. Meanwhile, All India United Democratic Front President Badruddin Ajmal pounced on Gogoi's remark to demand the Chief Minister's removal.

"By saying that most of Assam's Muslims are illiterate, he's admitted to having failed at his job. If illiteracy among Muslims causes population growth, what has he done in 11 years? Having accepted responsibility for the BTAD crisis as well, he's lost the right to continue as Chief Minister," he said. Ajmal's words failed to cut ice with All Assam Minority Students' Union (AAMSU). It sees logic in Gogoi's theory. "His statement reflects the plight of the state's minorities. It's high time the government woke up to the needs of Assam's minorities," said AAMSU President Abdur Rahim Ahmed. Gogoi has a supporter in academic circles too. "There is evidence to support what Gogoi said. Look at the population growth rate of Assam's most literate districts. Jorhat's literacy rate is 83.42 per cent but growth rate is just 9.21 per cent. And Dhubri, which ranks lowest in literacy, has the highest population growth rate," says B. K. Sarma, director, Omeo Kumar Das Institute of Social Change and Development. When pointed out that Cachar's population grew at 20.17 despite a high literacy rate of 80.36 per cent, Sarma said: "Let us not forget that there is a sizeable Muslim population of 36.1 per cent in Cachar."
