Keen to shed its image of a party that promotes hooliganism, the Samajwadi Party (SP) has given a ticket to former Uttar Pradesh Ranji captain JYOTI YADAV Jyoti Yadav, 34, as part of its makeover. Jyoti will be making his debut on the political pitch as SP's candidate for the Allahabad West Assembly seat. His father, Gopal Das Yadav, was Janata Dal MLA from the same constituency in 1984-1989 and is close to SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav. Jyoti's selection has, however, caused heartburn among party veterans who object to his lack of experience. SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary, however, denied any discontent within the party and said the former cricketer was picked on the basis of his winnability. Jyoti is playing it cool. "My father's clean image will help me," he says.

T

he Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls have become the ultimate showcase for SUVs. Topping the list are Toyota Fortuners, Tata Safaris, Toyota Innovas and Mahindra

Scorpios. The demand for the Fortuner is so high that in Kanpur, there is a waiting period of nine months. "There was a sharp jump in demand once poll dates were announced," says

Vijay Sahu, owner of the Sunny Toyota showroom in Kanpur. In Varanasi, there is a waiting list of 90 for Fortuners. Safari, the most popular vehicle during cam-

paigning for the last Assembly elections in 2007, has slipped. The fact that campaigning coincided with a Rs 70,000 discount on the Safari worked well, points out D.K. Singh

of Society Motors Limited, Kanpur. But the vehicle is still considered a safe bet for the potholed roads of Uttar Pradesh, adds Sarvesh Kumar of Sai Motors, Kanpur. While star campaign-

ers have their favourites, the generational gap is evident. Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party likes the Mitsubishi Pajero and Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi prefers the Toyota Prado. But BJP firebrand Uma Bharati doesn't look beyond the good old Ambassador.

PAPA'S PROJECT
New UPA ally Ajit Singh clearly has grand plans for son Jayant Chaudhary. In a surprise move, the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief announced that the 31-yearold Chaudhary, currently Mathura MP and the party's star campaigner in the Uttar Pradesh elections, will enter the poll fray from Mat Assembly constituency. Get ready for another sonrise should the Congress-RLD alliance pull off a shock victory in the state.

BAND OF NEPHEWS
While Mulayam Singh Yadav tries to win over the rest of Uttar Pradesh, his band of nephews is busy defending the Yadav citadel in Etawah. The Bahujan Samaj Party holds sway in three of the four Assembly seats in this Lok Sabha constituency-- Bharthana, Etawah and Lakhana. Jaswantnagar seat is with the Samajwadi Party's (SP) Shivpal Yadav, Mulayam's brother. Shivpal's son Aditya alias Ankur Yadav, 24, an engineering graduate, is holding fort in Jaswantnagar. Another Yadav sibling, 22-year-old Tej Pratap Singh, is the youngest campaigner. His father, the late Ranveer Singh Yadav, was Mulayam's nephew. A management graduate, Tej went on a padyatra in Etawah's Saifai bazaar in the second week of January. Lakhana is being managed by Anshul Yadav, 25, an MBA and son of Mulayam's younger brother Rajpal. While campaigning, Anshul assures people that all their problems will be solved once SP returns to power. Mulayam's nephews have professional degrees but then there's no business like the election business. by Ashish Misra

he Punjab Congress nominee from Barnala constituency is worth Rs 136 crore. That's the figure Kewal Dhillon, 61, wrote on his nomination form as the combined wealth of his assets and those of his wife Manjeet and son Karan. Dhillon listed luxury watches, high-end cars, real estate, gold and silver, Rs 30 crore in bank deposits and Rs 2.54 crore in jewellery. He beats Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh (Rs 45.74 crore) and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Badal (Rs 94.46 crore) in personal wealth. Will all his wealth ensure a win?

GANDHIS' DAY OUT
Bibi Jagir Kaur has been pulled up by the Election Commission, acting on complaints that she was allegedly trying to bribe voters by distributing free liquor. The Shiromani Akali Dal candidate from Bholath constituency has a tough task ahead with as many as eight candidates in the fray. But she isn't the only one facing stiff competition. Raninder Singh, Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh's son, also faces seven contestants in Samana seat.

e are fortunate as a people to live in the most plural democracy of the world. Once again, elections are knocking on our door and there's the dilemma.Whether to vote or not? Whom to vote for? And why? And will my vote truly count? One can build thousands of arguments in its conceptual favour and against its prevailing reality. But I believe no matter what happened in the past and no matter what will happen in the future, we should vote. I am not someone who is politically aligned but being a citizen of this country, I am observing the electoral process keenly.These elections will be crucial in many ways. Our country has witnessed a mass movement against corruption recently.We have to

Her hair styled in soft curls and wearing long sleeved sari blouses, Priyanka Vadra cajoled Amethi voters, saying,"I only come during polls. You can scold me."She played dutiful sister, saying she would campaign wherever Rahul wants.

Sonia Gandhi hit the campaign field on a strident note in Roorkee, Uttarakhand.Wearing a woollen phiran, she lashed out at the BJP in fluent Hindi.And, no surprises here, talked about her pet social welfare schemes.

Rahul has a trademark look this time: a stubble threatening to grow into a beard and sleeves rolled up. Congressmen say he expects at least 100 seats in Uttar Pradesh.Will the party live up to his self-declared goal?

WEDDING BLUES

S

ix months ago, Tej Narayan Panday aka Pawan Panday, the Samajwadi Party candidate from Ayodhya in Faizabad, fixed his wedding for January 18. Panday didn't know about poll dates then and sent out wedding invites to over 25,000 people. Now that the poll dates are out and the model code of conduct is in place, Panday has had to whittle down his guest list to 100. Ayodhya goes to polls on February 8. by Ashish Misra

see if corruption emerges as a deciding issue in the elections as well. If it was a movement of the middle class, which otherwise takes little interest in voting, corruption could emerge as a critical issue because the middle class would then turn out to vote. As time draws near, the oft-repeated scenario will once again unfold before us: many, if not all, politicians chasing their self-interest at any cost, making promises and breaching trust later. Caste and religious equations will come to the fore again. The issue is whether we want this scenario to continue or change for the better. If we want change, we will have to come forward.We will have to make politicians realise that there are broader, more basic issues.That caste and religion-based politics cannot be a determining factor.We need development, good education for our children, health benefits for the family, clean water, regular electricity, job opportunities. People need to come forward and take the lead in rejecting petty equations of self-interest.We need an educated, informed and broadminded society.And this cannot be left to the politicians alone. Each section of our society will have to contribute.To shape a future, we have to soil our hands in the present. It's our present and our future that's at stake.The baton is in our hands and we must run the distance.

A SOP STORY
Mulayam Singh Yadav came up with a rather unusual poll sop recently. The Samajwadi Party (SP) chief has promised to phase out cycle-rickshaws and replace them with motorised rickshaws. This may appeal to the vote bank of daily wage-earners but it has confused party workers. The cycle is SP's symbol.
