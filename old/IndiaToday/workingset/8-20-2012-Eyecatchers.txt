INDIA INK
Mumbai's international airport has some of the strangest sights--like Saif Ali Khan with hair a disgusting shade of orange, black beard and a mess on his arms, which is supposed to be tattoos of Aztec symbols. That's his idea of looking like a Russian mafioso in Go Goa Gone. Ugh. Priyanka Chopra, however, flew in from Malibu with `Daddy's Lil' Girl' inked on her wrist, streaks in her hair, and bangs, looking boho chic. Khan will also be hunting a zombie in the film. He better find it soon, or it will be a new girlfriend that he will be hunting for.
