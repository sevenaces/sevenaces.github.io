HOW TO GET AROUND

TAKE THE BUS
Buses are one of the cheapest ways to get around London, although they're relatively slow. They have an added advantage of running all night on some routes. Oyster Cards help reduce ticket prices from £2.30 (Rs 198) to £1.35 (Rs 116)for a one-way ticket.

FLAG A CAB
For a comfortable ride, hitch a Black Cab (although they now come in many colours). The minimum fare is £2.20 (Rs 190) but the meter runs pretty quickly so avoid long distances. However, the cabbies are well trained and you will never get lost. Also, they're legally required to accept all journeys that fall under 12 km.

THE BORIS BIKE
If you're the active sort, hop on a Boris bike, named after the city's bike-friendly Mayor Boris Johnson. You only need to swipe a debit or credit card to get going. The first 30 minutes are free but the charge increases with time. Drop them off at any bike stand in the city.

TUBE CENTRAL
The London Tube is efficient but expensive. It will get crowded in peak hours and during the Games. Thankfully, most attractions fall within Zone 1, so you don't need to be in it for too long. Some Games venues fall outside Zone 1, so check before travelling. The cheapest ticket is £4.30 (Rs 370). Use an Oyster Card for up to 50 per cent discounts.
