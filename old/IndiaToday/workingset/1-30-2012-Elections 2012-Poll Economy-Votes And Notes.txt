ing. Kumar, 40, supplies tents, chairs, stages and loudspeakers for small rallies across the district. Each such small rally, which Kumar calls a nukkad sabha (neighbourhood gathering), costs anywhere between Rs 10,000-Rs 20,000. There are three-four such sabhas everyday, with the four major political parties actively involved. The cost of tents and other material for campaigning has gone up by about 50 per cent. Kumar says that all his material has been booked in advance by different candidates in the Basti Sadar constituency. He expects to earn between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh per day for the next 20 days. "This is 40 per cent more than what I earn in peak marriage season," he adds. The only spanner in the booming Candidates need to cover a lot of ground. Vehicles are in demand and transporters are ready to oblige, at a price. The cost of fuel is not included in the monthly hire charges of vehicles.

opal Aggarwal, 40, proprietor of Gopal Taxis, opposite Ludhiana railway station, is feeling good. "Taxi charges more than double during elections," he says. The daily rental for a Toyota Qualis since campaigning began for the January 30 Punjab Assembly elections has gone up from Rs 900 to Rs 1,600. It isn't just the rates that excite Aggarwal. "The best bit is that all payments are received in advance. I cannot risk credit because once the campaign is over, political parties play truant. It's entirely a cash-andcarry operation," he says. In Basti in Uttar Pradesh, Kamal Kumar's tent house business is boom-

election economy is the Election Commission (EC), which has a mandate to ensure that excessive money power does not distort a level playing field. In September 2011, the EC issued a 165page document titled `Instructions on Election Expenditure Monitoring' addressed to the chief electoral officers of the five election-bound states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur. Election officials are implementing instructions stringently. Not all businessmen are unhappy with the strict monitoring. Firms that rent hoardings to political parties are delighted. Says Parminder Cheema, 44, Hoshiarpur-based vice-president of Greenline, the largest signage company in Punjab, "The monitoring has put almost every illegal dealer of hoardings out of business." According to him, the EC has prevented private rooftops from being utilised as sites for party or candidate hoardings. Adds Cheema, "All dealers like us are also legally required to submit daily statements listing the party-wise position on public hoardings." His business has seen a 30 per cent rise in revenue in the run-up to the Assembly elections. Like Aggarwal of Gopal Taxis, Cheema too points out that all payments are made in advance during election time, something that is unheard of during normal times. Thousands of kilometres away, in Manipur, not everyone wants strict monitoring of poll expenditure by the EC. Elections in the north-eastern state are usually marked by many rounds of feasting. "Any occasion in Manipur is good enough for a feast but this time, there is no rise in demand for fish, rice or other items that are necessary for organising feasts," says Rajendra, 38, a trader in Imphal's Thangal Bazaar area. In the hill areas, the norm during election time is for the entire village to feast on a pig, cow or buffalo. A pig would cost about Rs 30,000-Rs 35,000 depending on its weight, while a cow or buffalo would cost about Rs 80,000-Rs 90,000. In Imphal and other towns where there is more scrutiny, large-scale feasts have given way to small groups of four-five peo-

ple eating at home. Pork prices have gone up marginally to Rs 200 per kg from Rs 180 per kg. The hoardings and banner business in Imphal is also struggling because of EC rules. Y. Dina Singh, 41, the proprietor of Dina Advertising who takes orders for signboards and road-side hoardings, says, "There has been a

sharp decline in the number of orders for publicity material like signboards and road-side hoardings. For the last councillor elections to the Imphal Municipality, which took place in April 2011, we got huge orders for both print and flex-print banners, leaving us with a profit margin of about Rs 20,000. The EC curbs on the Assembly elections have

affected business and we are not able to break even this time around." In Uttar Pradesh, many politicians are doing their best to find novel ways of dodging the EC rules and enforcement personnel. Enforcement officials in the past have tended to check SUVs

and bigger cars for cash. This time around, members of the Flying Squad and Static Surveillance Teams, deputed by the EC in various districts to keep a watch on the use of black money in the election, have been surprised to find huge quantities of cash being transported in small cars to dodge the police. On January 2, in the

Shikarpur area of Bulandshahr, members of the Flying Squad stopped a Nano for routine checking at a barrier. The members of the team found Rs 8 lakh on the back seat of the car. The cash was seized as the owner of the car failed to convince the Flying Squad about its intended purpose. In a separate incident, Rs 9.5 lakh was seized from an Alto in the Chandausi area of Bulandshahr district. More than Rs 4 crore of unaccounted money has been seized in the various districts of Uttar Pradesh so far, almost always in small cars. Bulandshahr Superintendent of Police R.K.S. Rathore says the use of small cars to ferry money is a new tactic adopted by politicians to dodge the EC. In another ingenious route to circumvent EC rules on spending, candidates of major parties in Uttar Pradesh are putting up dummy candidates in their constituency. These dummy candidates actually work in favour of the major candidates and are simply a front for additional legitimate spending. In the last Assembly election in 2007, 5,533 candidates contested the election. According to an officer of the State Election Office, around 25 per cent of them were dummy candidates. In Punjab, all District Electoral Officers have taken the unusual step of setting rates for almost everything that the average candidate spends on, including tea and samosas. As a result, in Punjab, there is little inflation in prices of key food items. In Uttar Pradesh, prices have gone up marginally (see graphic). Of course, not all of the rise is to do with illegitimate spending. There is, without doubt, a genuine increase in economic activity. Apart from political spending, there is also an increase in spending by government officials. In Uttar Pradesh, six lakh government officials have been posted on electionrelated duty. Each gets a daily allowance of Rs 750. That will eventually be spent on food and accommodation. Black or white, businesses are certainly not complaining. It's probably unfortunate that elections come only once in five years.
