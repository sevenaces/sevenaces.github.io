GLASS HOUSE SWAMI EFFECT

by KAVEREE BAMZAI

ardar Vallabhbhai Patel, please step aside. Swami Vivekananda is here. Or so Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's admirer, Bharat Kanabar, thinks. The general physician and Amreli district BJP president issued an advertisement in a local newspaper, comparing Modi to the great Swami Vivekananda. Kanabar, 55, even photoshopped Modi's face to resemble Swami Vivekananda's. Both men, says Kanabar, restored the self-esteem of the common man with their "visionary beliefs" . We know several people who will disagree.

ROLLER COASTER

NOT WRITE
ndhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy needs a new speechwriter. At the Global Partnership Summit in Hyderabad, he referred to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's monetary policy as innovative and "imaginary". He also said the Government's resources were dwelling. We presume he meant dwindling. This from a man who was made chief minister because he belonged to the "English-speaking" politician set, currently high on Rahul Gandhi's most favoured list.

TOUR OF DUTY

T HE H IGH AND T HE L OW
Inflation hit a two-year low of 7.47 per cent in December 2011. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said he expects it to come down to between 6 and 7 per cent by March. Fingers crossed. West Bengal Chief Minister's pet project of playing Rabindra Sangeet at traffic intersections for 16 hours a day has robbed Raj Bhavan staffers of sleep. The volume of songs has now been lowered at the six intersections surrounding Raj Bhavan. At 10 p.m., the police switch them off completely.

APPLY TO DUSTBIN
What happens when one sends an application for a job in the Social Welfare Ministry in Assam? The sealed envelope will be thrown into the dustbin. On January 16, when a scrap collector opened three bags he got from the Uzan Bazaar-based office of the ministry in Guwahati, he was in for a shock. There were hundreds of unopened envelopes that had applications for the post of lower division clerk. So how was the merit list prepared? Social Welfare Minister Akon Bora has no answer.

FIRST DATE
His grandfather drafted the Constitution and Dr B.R. Ambedkar's grandson Prakash, 57, seems to have inherited the writing skills. The Congress-NCP alliance is seeking help from his party Bharip-Bahujan Mahasangh in the Zilla Parishad elections in Maharashtra. They're looking for Dalit votes. But he's in no hurry. "Our party is like a beautiful woman with whom everybody wants to flirt," he told INDIA TODAY. "We will go with those who will take us on a date first." We'll tell you how the romance fares.

nion Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar has sought permission from the Maharashtra State Election Commission to tour the state starting from January-end to assess the drought-like situation. No surprise that the state is all set to vote for 27 Zilla Parishads on February 6. Pawar's proposed tour may well help NCP win votes. Does the Election Commission know?

SPANISH TOUCH
ow do you say baith jaiye, in Spanish? Well, one only has to ask Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar. Kumar is currently leading a parliamentary delegation to Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay and wowing people with her proficiency in Spanish. It's a language she picked up while serving as an IFS officer in Spain.

udheendra Kulkarni, columnist and former strategist for BJP leader L.K. Advani, is back to working full-time for the party. This time, it's for BJP President Nitin Gadkari. Party insiders confirm that Kulkarni, who spent 52 days in Tihar Jail, is quitting Observer Research Foundation. He had left the party in August 2009 after publicly blaming the RSS for making a "strong leader'' like Advani appear weak and helpless. Kulkarni's first task? Helped finetune the BJP's vision document for Uttar Pradesh, released on January 16 in Lucknow.

BORDER TALK
hat Indian MPs have ordained, not even an imminent coup in Pakistan can change. Twelve MPs spent three days in Pakistan beginning January 16. Cutting across party lines, the delegation headed by Mani Shankar Aiyar had Baijayant "Jay" Panda (BJD), Supriya Sule (NCP), Deepender Hooda (Congress) N.K. Singh (JD-U) and Yashwant Sinha (BJP). While they were building relations between India and Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari and Ashfaq Parvez Kayani were busy destroying the one between them.

low. Sharma, who is often on his own, since his wife and children live in London, prefers the comfort of his smaller Lodi Estate house which is usually allotted to MPs. Given the rush for ministerial bungalows, Nath's ministry should be happy that Sharma has declined.
