Discoms subsidise every unit sold for Rs 8,000 crore losses per year, impose heavy unofficial cuts in supply to reduce losses.

Scorching summer and little rain exposes India's critical power generation situation. Blackouts are the order of the day. And there is no respite in sight.
By Devesh Kumar

hailendra Sethi, 50, owns a defence equipment manufacturing unit in Kanpur's Panki Industrial Area that needs 10,000 units of power per month to run at its optimal capacity. But production has been hit hard by 6-8 hour daily power cuts. The factory got only 6,000 units in June 2012. "Our turnover is Rs 10 lakh per month, but I have suffered a loss of Rs 4 lakh last month due to power cuts," says Sethi. Sethi's plight is shared by industrialists, businessmen and the common man across the country. This summer has been particularly tough. The prolonged spell of heat and the delay in

S

monsoons has aggravated the power crisis. The Union power ministry may claim demand-supply gap in the power sector has been narrowing down due to augmentation in generation capacity in the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-08 to 2011-12), but the situation on the ground remains grim, with reports of people taking to the streets to protest frequent and prolonged outages pouring in from virtually all corners. The power ministry, for instance, claims to have added capacity worth 56,816 MW during the Eleventh Five Year Plan, but shortages in coal supply and irrational tariff have ensured plants either sit idle or function much below their capacity. Again, bankrupt discoms do not have the resources to buy power.

They are either subsidised by government or constrained to take loans from banks to purchase power. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has accused the previous Mayawati regime of saddling the UP Power Corporation with a Rs 25,000 crore loss incurred by buying electricity at high rates. "Banks are now refusing loans to the Corporation," he said in Lucknow on July 4. Aggregate Transmission and Commercial (AT&C) losses across India, which average 27 per cent, have accentuated the problem. There are large variations in power deficit across the country.  While Bihar posted a peak gap of 22.1 per cent in May, Himachal Pradesh showed 11.6 per cent deficit in June.  Tamil Nadu needs 12,500 MW daily,

but generates only 8,500 MW. Since 1995, no new power plants have become operational in the state. In the past seven years, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board added 333 MW in capacity, but demand rose by 3,791 MW.  There is a total shortfall of 107 MW during off-peak hours and 273 MW during peak hours in Assam. The state needs 1,100 MW every day. According to government data, Assam gets 751 MW from the Centre with 408 MW being generated by the state. Says Shyamkanu Mahanta, consultant on hydropower projects, "Of the three large state units, two are underperforming. Namrup Thermal is running at 58 per cent capacity, Lakwa Thermal at 75 per cent."  Bihar needs 3,000 MW daily, but its deficit is 1,800 MW. The biggest cause of this crisis is zero generation by the state. Worse still, it incurs a distribution loss of up to 40 per cent.  The average annual hydel power generation in Andhra Pradesh in the last 10 years has been 5,775 million units (MU), against a target of 7,185 MU. The state is also suffering from a shortfall in gasbased power supply, to the tune of 1,300 MW, against an installed capacity of 2,494.70 MW.  The situation is better in Delhi, but it still suffered 2-3 hours of cuts every day in the height of summer this year. Peak demand hit 5,600 MW, 12 per cent above 2011. The situation has improved in the city since distribution was handed over to Reliance-owned BSES and Tata

Power-DDL in 2002, when the city used to lose more than 50 per cent of its supply in transmission. Ten years on, it is around 15 per cent, less than the national average. "Delhi is an oasis among power-starved neighbours," says Gopal K. Saxena, CEO, BSES Rajdhani. With temperatures soaring and rains playing truant, May and June were cruel on consumers. According to Central Electricity Authority data, peak demand in May was 1,29,030 MW, while peak supply by discoms was 1,18,608 MW, leaving an overall deficit of 10,422 MW (8.1 per cent). The situation was particularly grim in the south (12.1 per cent) and the north (8.1 per cent). It touched a peak of 25 per cent in Jammu and Kashmir, 23.4 per cent in Punjab and 22.1 per cent in Bihar, follwoed by Tamil Nadu (14.4 per cent), Haryana (13.8 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (13 per cent) and Odisha (10.1 per cent). India's total installed power generation capacity on May 31 this year was 2,02,979 MW, with thermal units (coal, gas and diesel-based) accounting for 66.3 per cent. Despite the Indo-US nu-

PETROLEUM MINISTRY
Inadequate new exploration and trouble at Reliance's KG-D6 basis has seen gas supply to power plants go down, holding up 5,000-6,000 MW of generation capacity. If policy uncertainty continues, gas production is unlikely to rise.

MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT AND FORESTS
Its decision to withhold environmental clearances and classify forests into "go/no-go" areas has stalled coal mining. Clearances for projects are a problem.For example, two 4,000 MW ultra mega power projects in Odisha and Chhattisgarh have not been given green nod.

clear deal, nuclear energy comprises a mere 2.4 per cent of total capacity. The first unit of Tamil Nadu's Kudankulam nuclear plant, delayed by protests, with 1,000 MW daily capacity, is expected to be operational by August 2012. Says Ashok Khurana, director general, Association of Power Producers (APP), "At least 50 per cent of the plants set up during the Eleventh Plan for an added capacity of 56,816 MW, have been working at sub-optimal levels due to fuel shortages." State power utilities, which have run cumulative losses of around Rs 2 lakh crore and an equal amount of credit as short-term loans, don't have the money to buy power. With several states hamstrung by power shortages, a blame game is on to fix accountability. The power ministry blames the coal and petroleum ministries for poor fuel supply, and state discoms for distribution lapses. The coal ministry blames the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) for crippling its excavations. The recent coal block allocation scam has rendered the coal ministry virtually non-functional--

no fresh coal linkages have been approved since April 2010. Activist-friendly MOEF policies have also meant states like Uttarakhand, with huge hydroelectric potential, have seen no addition to capacity since the brouhaha over Tehri Dam. The Northeastern states, similarly endowed, are too far from the power-hungry plains for plants set up there to be viable. "The Electricity Act 2003 had made a case for gradual movement towards a market-based system in generation, transmission and distribution," says Gajendra Haldea, member of Planning Commission. "But distribution continues to be with state-owned monopolies. Wherever competition was allowed, problems have been resolved." State governments, fearful of anger at possible tariff hikes, have been wary of privatising discoms. "The P-word remains a no-no for almost all state governments," says a power ministry official. Indeed, distribution constitutes the weakest link in power supply. State electricity boards (SEBS), responsible for supply, have been in dire straits from

What's wrong State generates very little, with 40 per cent loss in distribution. the mid-1950s. In its 2011-12 report, the Planning Commission noted: "The Venkataraman Committee reported in 1964 that the return on their (SEBS') investments was poor. The committee, however, did concede that part of the poor returns was due to SEBS being burdened with the responsibility of electrifying rural areas, where expenditure and losses were both high." To top this, the Samajwadi Party, on the eve of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls in February-March, vowed to provide free power to farmers and weavers for 18 hours every day. So did the Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab, and AIADMK in Tamil Nadu. In India, thermal remains the most important source of power generation. But nods to fresh gas-based thermal projects have been put on hold as the petroleum ministry has made it clear that production of gas from the New Exploration Licensing Policy was likely to go down. "Up to 5,000-6,000 MW of gas-based capacity is ready to be commissioned, but was not made opera-

tional for lack of gas," says a power ministry official. This has made the tasks of the coal ministry and Coal India Ltd (CIL) unenviable. "While the power sector has grown at 8-9 per cent in every Plan, CIL has exhibited a negative growth in last three years," the official adds. According to power ministry estimates, at least 500 million tonnes of coal is needed to run these plants at optimal capacity. "We don't have adequate supply," alleges Ashok Khurana of APP. "The gap between demand and supply, for the thermal plants to operate at 85 per cent plant load factor, is 55 million tonnes. With every passing year, this will widen," he adds. Meanwhile, coal prices across the world have shot up. Production in the first unit of the Mundra ultra mega power plant (UMPP), which uses imported coal, has been held up since March because international coal producers have decided to reset prices every 12 months after factoring in international prices and availability. Environmental concerns expressed by the MOEF have also nixed several thermal plants. Proposals for two UMPPS of 4,000 MW each, at Badabaha in Odisha and Surguja in Chhattisgarh, were shot down by MOEF. And 26 coal blocks in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha have come under its "no-go areas". India is staring at a long summer of discontent.
