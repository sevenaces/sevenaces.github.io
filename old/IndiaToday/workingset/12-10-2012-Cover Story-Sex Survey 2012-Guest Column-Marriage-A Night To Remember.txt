This may sound very basic, but what am I supposed to do with the lights? 1. On 2. Off 3. Dimmed 4. Psychedelic? ANSWER I love the way your mind works! The fact that you're thinking it through is half the battle won. I'd start with dimmed lights; it looks romantic and sexy. As the action heats up, you can go either way. Save the psychedelic lights for later though...


Open letter from: Kamini Motwani, friend, marriage counsellor and interrogator nonpareil (from Drop Dead, A Niki Marwah Mystery) To: The Bashful Bridegroom The writer is the author of Piece of Cake, A Girl Like Me and Drop Dead, A Niki Marwah Mystery arrrrling! You're getting married!! Congratulations!!! I love a good marriage! It's the perfect combination of the two most important things in life: Sex and fashion! The lehengas, the suhaag raat, the kangans, the kesar doodh, the polki sets, the silk boxers and lace negligees... Oh, you and your gharwallas have got the fashion part all covered? That's great! But what about sex? Have you thought about that? I mean, really thought about it? About how you're going to knock her socks off and leave her screaming and begging for more? Because that's what it's all about. Giving as good as you get... I can see from the way your eyes just glazed over that while it is exactly the result you so very badly want, you have no idea how to get there. I've seen that look many times before; it's the same look that comes over contestants on KBC after they have exhausted their last lifeline before the final padaav. The look that says I want it. I'm almost there. I've no idea what to do now. Help me, someone! Luckily for you, darling, your lifeline is sitting right in front of you! Go ahead, ask the expert, ask me anything.  I can't decide where to take my bride for our honeymoon. What is the sexiest place to go? 1. Beach resort 2. Hill station 3.Wildlife sanctuary 4. Disney World ANSWER The jungle, my friend. Awaken her animal instincts. The beach has too many competing bikinis, the hills have too many puffy jackets. Disney is for kids, but the jungle is where you go wild.

What is the best position to give her pleasure? Do women like to be on... 1.Top 2. Bottom 3. Sideways 4. Sixty-nine ANSWER You'll have time enough to try them all out, darling! Do you know the Kama Sutra mentions 64 positions? When it comes to positions, there are no wrong answers! Just make sure she's just as willing.
 Where does one stop? 1. Once 2.Twice 3.Thrice 4.As soon as she starts to feel uncomfortable? ANSWER 4, darling, always, and without exception.  I hear everyone is reading Fifty Shades of Grey now. My friends tell me BDSM is what all women secretly crave. What would you recommend? 1.Ties 2. Handcuffs 3.Whips 4. Rope ANSWER On your wedding night? Shudders! Your wife may have read Fifty Shades, even enjoyed it, but in real life, BDSM is not for everyone, my friend. I'd say check with her before investing in any of the above. In the meantime, how about a good oldfashioned, time-tested shower for two?

 I want to give my bride a gift on our suhaag raat. What would make the sexiest pre-sex gift? 1. Chocolates 2. Sexy lingerie 3. Perfume 4. Diamonds ANSWER Lovely sentiment, a little something at the right moment can make a lot happen. But do you really have to ask which one? Believe me when I say this, diamonds are a girl's best friend.  I'm not sure what to wear on our wedding night.

1. Boxers 2. Briefs 3. Pyjamas 4. Sleep shorts ANSWER I am so glad you're thinking about this. Your wife of course will have a suitcase full of lacy nothings to entice you with. Shouldn't you entice her back? Get that smooth shave, that sharp haircut, that sexy wardrobe... and for your special night, go with something special and flattering, like silk boxers or low-slung pyjamas in black... mmmm!
