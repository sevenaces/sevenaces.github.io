There's only one way to make sense of the summer, and that's to get as far as possible from Delhi's heat. I'm heading off for a week to Spain, where I'm looking forward to plow my way through the food, along with some sangrias and siestas.

The best thing to do to beat the summer heat is to get away to a cool and beautiful spot. For instance, the Norwegian Fjords are wonderful and very inspirational. But if I'm not travelling, then I prefer tucking in lots of cold soups and fruit salads to keep myself light and energised during the day.

When the going gets hot, I get into my fuss-free mode--whether it's clothes, makeup or attitude. A waterbased moisturiser, tea tree face wash and Evian water spray are my skincare essentials. I like spending summer evenings with my friends and family at home, while I cook a nice meal for them. I also practice Buddhism, which is my ideal stress-buster.
