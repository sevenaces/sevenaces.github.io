he present Government headed by Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has completed the first year in office of its third consecutive term. 11 years ago, when the Government assumed power, there was darkness all around with chaos and mayhem reigning supreme. With development as its mantra, the Tarun Gogoi Government went on with its daunting tasks on a mission with a vision to put Assam back on the track by achieving fiscal consolidation through a slew of financial management and discipline measures. Per capita income has gone up from Rs 13,962 in 2001-02 to an amazing Rs 37,481 in 2011-12. The GDR which stood at a dismal 2.1 per cent in 2001, has touched 8 per cent. With the economic turnaround, the law and order situation, too improved significantly. The

From the above table it is evident that the percentage increase in real growth rate or speed of improvement in economic growth in Assam has been 182 percent, which is well above states like Gujarat, Rajasthan and Kerala. Most strikingly, the State's rate of growth of 7.34 percent during 2009-2012 has been greater than the rate of growth of the country which has been pegged at 7.96 percent, thereby indicating a closing to the gap between the State and the Country. The average real growth rate of Assam was 2.21 percent during 1994-2002. The same has increased to 5.91 percent during 2002-2012, registering an increase of 167.4 percent over the earlier period. The corresponding all India rate has been 28 percent. Therefore, it appears that the percentage improvement in economic growth of Assam has been about 6 times more than that of the Country level.

The most interesting aspect of the Planning Commission's data is that since 2001-2002 (start of the Congress rule in Assam) the State never experienced any decline in the growth rates. In fact, the Statels economy has shown

AnimPACTFeature
tremendous improvement during last ten years from the deplorable conditions of 2000-2001, and recent growth estimates clearly speak for themselves. Most significantly, this remarkable turnaround to the State's economy from the quagmire of 2000-2001 has not only remained limited to growth performances of the state. The India Human Development Report of 2011 has clearly shown that the State has performed appreciably in all fronts of human development. The report states that "What is remarkable is that for five of the low HDI states the improvement in HDI is considerably above the national average. These are Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Assam. Of the three indices used to measure the overall human development index, the report places Assam at the top among all the states in terms of percentage change in income index from 1999-2000 to 2007-08. The report shows that the income index for Assam has improved from 0.152 (1999-2000) to 0.288 (200708) marking an increase of near 90 percent compared to all India improvement of mere 21 percent. The education index has also increased from 0.516 (1999-2000) to 0.636 (2007-08) registering an improvement of about 23 percent. % of change in HDI between 1999-2000 & 2007-2008

It is, however, a matter of concern that improvement in the health index of the State has not been as impressive as income and education index, which is suggestive of serious challenges for all of us. The health index, which was 0.339 (1999-00) has risen to 0.407 (2007-08) indicating an increase of about 20 percent during the period, which is nevertheless, higher than the relative national increase of 13 percent during the same period. % change in Income index from 1999-2000 & 2007-2008
