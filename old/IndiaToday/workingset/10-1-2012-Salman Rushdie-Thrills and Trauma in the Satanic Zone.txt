t was on Valentine's Day more than two decades ago when a BBC reporter called him on his private number and asked, "How does it feel to know that you have just been sentenced to death by Ayatollah Khomeini?" "It doesn't feel good," he said. One metaphor that would haunt him in his dreams after that loveless, sunny Tuesday morning in 1989, the year of freedom in some other parts of the world, was the plague of "lethal blackbirds" in a Hitchcock film--"the early fluttering that would become a storm." This morning in Bedford Square in the Bloomsbury district of central London, there are no birds of dark foreboding on the windowsills of the Georgian building that houses the offices of Wiley Agency that represents him. For Salman Rushdie who sits across me in a room in the basement, the summer air exudes only the joy of being alive--and writing. On the huge conference table, it is all Salman Rushdie, in different languages, in soft covers and hardback, but a few hot-off-the-press copies of Joseph Anton, a book born out of the darkest recesses of his existence, take pride of place. "I always wanted to write a book with a person's name as the title, like David Copperfield, like Robinson Crusoe. I'm happy that I finally wrote that book," he says. There was a time when he wondered whether he would survive his own story to write about it. The person on the cover, Joseph Anton, is a name he invented for himself when he was the most protected--and threatened--storyteller on earth, when life was in permanent transition from safe house to safer house, when death was an intimate fear. His protection officers wanted him to have a new name, preferably not an Asian one. Rushdie wanted to create one out of the writers he loved, but in the end, it was not Vladimir Joyce or Marcel Beckett; it came from Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov. "I remembered a conversation I had with Edward Said, himself a

scholar of Conrad. We talked about this sentence in Conrad's Nigger of the Narcissus: `I must live until I die, mustn't I?' Edward himself had to think about this when he was diagnosed with cancer. And that was the way he lived; he went on lecturing and writing even as he knew that he was dying. The line became a motto for me too. And Chekov was the great poet of melancholy, isolation and alienation. I felt a bit like one of his Three Sisters yearning for a Moscow they lost. I felt that sense of being stuck in nowhere." Thus was born Joseph Anton, Joe for his protection team, and he must live until he dies. He must write. Joseph Anton ( Jonathan Cape; 636pp; Rs 799) , perhaps the only memoir written in the third person, is the story of a novelist banished by the extraterritorial tyranny of religion, a price tag hanging from his neck. And it is a memoir that uses the art and architecture of fiction. It could not have been otherwise, for the memoirist here is a writer who has challenged the limits of fiction, a writer who has translated the big whirl of an interconnected world into words resonant with the joys and sorrows, the magic and madness, the passions and pathologies of a merciless history. Joseph Anton is a different Rushdie at work: An overpopulated thriller based on true events, but powered by ideas and emotions, and as combustible and expansive as a vintage Russian novel. The Rushdie who animates the pages is a writer playing out his multiple roles, the script often being ghostwritten by a pitiless outsider. So we have Rushdie the son in an intimate, posthumous conversation with his father; a young failed novelist struggling for that breakthrough moment; a writer on the run in the shadow land where the clock is frozen and solitude is invasive; a storyteller who regains the lost word through a promise he made to his son; an incorrigible romantic rebuilding his life on the wreckage of failed marriages; an endangered fabulist who is eternally indebted to

what may seem inexplicable to others in the life of Rushdie. The fiction began before the fictions. "The first gift he received from his father, a gift like a message in a time capsule, which he didn't understand until he was an adult, was the family name," he writes in Joseph Anton. Rushdie was an invention by his father Anis, whose real name was Khwaja Muhammad Din Khaliqi Dehlavi, "a fine Old Delhi name". Anis adopted the name Rushdie inspired by Ibn Rushd, the twelfth century Spanish-Arab philosopher known as Averroes to the western world. "His son bore the name for two decades before he understood that his father, a true scholar of Islam who was also entirely lacking in religious belief, had chosen it because he respected Ibn Rushd for being at the forefront of the rationalist argument against Islamic literalism in his time; and twenty more years elapsed before the battle over The Satanic Verses provided a twentieth-century echo of that eight-hundred-year-old argument," he writes. "`At least,' he told himself when the storm broke over his head, `I'm going into the battle bearing the right name.' From beyond the grave his father had given him the flag under which he was ready to fight, the flag of Ibn Rushd, which stood for AP PHOTO intellect, argument, analysis and progress, for the freedom of philosophy and learning from the shackles of theology, for human reason and against blind faith, submission, acceptance and stagnation," writes the memoirist. The most affectionate--and literary--passages in Joseph Anton are about the "bumpy journey" of the two Rushdies as father and son. They looked alike, and they had the same voice. Above all, they shared the same "unbelief", the genesis of the novel that would be more burned, from the mean streets of Bradford to Karachi in a bonfire of hate, than read. Later, at Cambridge, not many students were interested in the origins of Islam. "He was his father's son, godless, but fascinated by gods and prophets." `Muhammad and the Rise of Islam' was one of his chosen subjects in history, and it was there he found out the original Satanic Verses. "`Good story,' he thought when he read about it. Even then he was dreaming of being a writer, and he filed the good story away in the back of his mind for future consideration. Twenty years later he would find out exactly how good a story it was," Rushdie writes. "Does Islam still fascinate you?" I ask him. "That is one of the reasons why I wrote this book. My story became part

the kindness and solidarity of friends. "Until this episode of The Satanic Verses happened, I had no interest in writing an autobiography. The reason I became a writer was to write fiction, not about myself," he says. When he wanted to write about himself, Rushdie had no idea how the story would end. "If it was going to end badly, I would not be in a position to write. I can't write until I know what the last chapter is. And for a long time, I had no idea about the last chapter--when it would come and whether it would be a happy ending or an extremely unhappy one." Nevertheless, he kept notes for all those years. And when he came out of his hell, he was in no mood to write. "I just wanted to lock the door behind me. I had to wait until I became more detached from the events." Joseph Anton is a fine example of "non-fiction novel", for Rushdie did not want to abandon his skill as a novelist. "The third person narrative allowed me to have objectivity about myself. All the characters, including me, exist at the same level. `I' separates me from the others." There is one character in Joseph Anton who explains

asked to be a good Muslim and save his life. He was vulnerable, and he was under pressure. A group of Muslim leaders offered to mediate between him and Tehran, offering him freedom from the Satanic trap in exchange for recantation. "It was my biggest mistake. Immediately after I was made to sign that document, I really felt sick, I understood that, somehow, I betrayed myself. It was like the bottom of the barrel," Rushdie says. He is wiser now. "In future, I'm not going anywhere near to compromise on things which are not to be compromised with." Still, in a curious way, "it was beneficial to me even though it was the most embarrassing moment of my life." For, he says, "out of that experience was born the strength to fight back." Joseph Anton tells the story of a mighty fightback from the death zone. The struggle has not always been about freedom from the jail without walls. It has also been about restoring the emotional balance in his personal life, about overcoming the misplaced fears about his publishers (one of them, Sonny Mehta, refused to publish Haroun and the Sea of Stories arguing that it was more explosive than The Verses), and most significantly, about keeping the words dancing in his subversive imagination. Friends were the consolation, and they offered cottages in the countryside and a secure place for the banished comrade in their hearts. Among them were Martin Amis (who famously said his friend had disappeared into the front page), Ian McEwan,

of the larger story of what had happened since 1989. Yes, I'm still interested in the political manifestation of Islam. We have to be. It is in the news every day. When I wrote The Satanic Verses, I was interested in the religion itself--its history, its origin. I do think something has gone wrong in Islam. There has been a growth of harsher Islam. Even in India, there is this rise of Arab Islam which is harsher. Sufi Islam, which is softer, was more prevalent in India before," he says. "Being on the liberal side of the aisle politically, you are not one of the buyers of the so-called Islamofascism theory, right?" "You cannot take a billion people and say they are bad. These are too many people to condemn. It is a naïve thing to do." Still, in his view, "it should be worrying to Muslims what is being done to them in the name of Islam all over the world." "Islam has not created anywhere a free open society--even where there are movements within demanding that, as we saw in the Arab Spring." "Don't you think the story of political Islam cannot be told without your own story, maybe like the story of communism cannot be told without the exile of Solzhenitsyn?" "I don't see myself that way. I didn't think that Islam was my subject. It just happened. I'm turning away from it. I'm not interested in it." Then, there was that moment in his life when he was

Hanif Kureishi, Graham Swift, Christopher Hitchens, and Vaclav Havel. "A lot of the book is about friendship, the extraordinary length they went to support me, to look after me. Even the police came to trust the friends. The special branch and the London literary world became very friendly," he says. He got on well with the Protection Guard, and he met at least hundred of them. "Today, when I watch politicians on stage, I can recognise security people standing behind them." He was once watching the visit of Nelson Mandela on television with his son Zafar, who suddenly cried out, "That is Fat Jack." "He was one of the protection officers who looked after us." This book is memoir as testament of truth, and the truth is likely to hurt some. All the four ex-Mrs Rushdies get their due in the narrative, and it is not always charitable. His most problematic relationship has been with his second wife, the formidable--and equally volatile--Marianne Wiggins, the American novelist. This about Padma

Lakshmi, his last wife: "(At a Vanity Fair dinner party) he watched her pose and pirouette for the human wall of screaming photographers, burning with the bright flame of her youth and beauty, he looked at the expression on her face and suddenly thought, She's having sex, sex with hundreds of men at the same time, and they don't even get to touch her, there's no way any actual man can compete with that. And in the end he lost her, yes, but it was better to lose one's illusion and live in the knowledge that the world was real, and that no woman could make it what he wanted it to be. That was up to him." Rushdie is writing "novelistically", and he has to tell everything as it is, which includes, by the way, a scene in which he hits his father. "Nobody is perfect," he says. Wives apart, lovers and stalkers too provide the drama. A Delhi woman flies all the way to London and even promises sex to his agent for a meeting with her obsession. In a novelistic memoir, they are bit players, but relevant to the story, which, you realise as you turn the last page, is larger than the picaresque of Joseph Anton through the cheerless alleys of history. "I wanted to tell what is happening in the world through the lived experience of what has happened to me," Rushdie says. Elsewhere, the story of the writer as outcast continues to be played out, in varying degrees of horror. Rushdie may not have gained his "lost futures" in spite of the triumph of Joseph Anton, the most intimate dramatisation of freedom from a writer who almost paid with his life for its survival. "A man's 40s is the prime of his life. And my 40s was spent in jail. I could have done a lot in those years. I was invited to see the pyramids by the American University in Cairo. I have never been to Egypt and now I cannot go," he says. Still,"however horrible the time was, I got a good book out of it," he can't resist the thrill of Joseph living a life in full, of Anton regaining home. A day after our conversation, literary London will have the biggest party of the season in a South Kensington club to celebrate the memoirist of freedom, and it is being organised by his son Zafar's event management company. That night he is the story everyone wants to listen, and there are no Hitchcockian blackbirds fluttering over Brompton Road.
