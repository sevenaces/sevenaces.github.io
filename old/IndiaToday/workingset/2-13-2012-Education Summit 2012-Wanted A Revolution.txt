n 2012, 65 years after independence, one out of every four Indians remains illiterate. While considerable progress has been made on ensuring that almost every child enrols in school, only 40 per cent of those who are admitted to primary school make it to secondary school. Just 16 out of every 100 Indians make it to university. If these statistics do not improve rapidly, India can expect a demographic disaster rather than a demographic dividend. On evidence, no country has become an economic superpower with such dismal indicators in education. The first INDIA TODAY Aspire Education Summit held in New Delhi on January 27 brought together policy officials, academic administrators, academics, schoolteachers and other

interested stakeholders from both the private and public sector to debate the challenges that confront education in India from primary school to university. The crux of the challenge is two-fold: first, that of access, the need to get more young Indians to enter and complete primary and secondary school and then to enter and complete university. Second, is the issue of quality. It isn't enough to get them into educational institutions. It's necessary to ensure that they have access to quality learning. In his inaugural keynote address at the summit, Union Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal was passionate about his effort to address with equal intensity the twin challenges of quantity and quality. Said Sibal, "In developed countries, 40 out of 100 students reach university. In India, only 16 in 100 do. My aim is to double India's gross enrolment ratio by 2020. That is

the only way India can fulfil its economic dreams." He was quick to point out that the existing number of 604 universities and 31,000 colleges were grossly inadequate to accommodate a doubling of the gross enrolment ratio. Sibal argued that the Centre did not have enough resources to meet the entire demand. "Education is also a state subject, but most states are not allocating enough funds for the sector," he said. The Union minister's attempt to shift some of the blame for India's dismal education statistics onto state governments seemed to go against his other central argument that education must be taken away from the clutches of the political system. Speaking before Sibal while opening the summit, INDIA TODAY Editorial Director M.J. Akbar made a strong case for depoliticising education. "Education is not a mere department of the

Government of India. It is a sacred trust. It is the one national responsibility which tempts me to suggest that it should not be run as a ministry but as a constitutional authority, in the manner of the Election Commission, beyond partisan lines inherent in the political system we have," he said. "Mass education", said Akbar "is the final challenge of the tryst with destiny that was promised by our first and greatest prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru." In a second keynote address, entrepreneur Shiv Nadar, the founder of one of India's top IT companies, HCL, spoke about his philanthropic initiative in taking "elite education" to rural India. Nadar highlighted the need to create institutions that would deliver a "stunning impact" through the students they nurture and act as role model institutions for others. "The Indian Institutes of Technology are the best examples of

such institutions. The alumni are part of the world's leading companies and have created 20 million jobs through their own start-ups. Their peers now aspire for the same success," said Nadar, who is working on creating what he calls "a Mayo or Doon" for the poor. He spoke about the two VidyaGyan schools the Shiv Nadar Foundation has set up in Uttar Pradesh, which offer top class learning and living facilities for rural children. "Seventy per cent of India is in rural areas. The knowledge disparity between rural children and their urban counterparts needs to be bridged," said Nadar. The schools actually scout rural schools all over Uttar Pradesh for the best talent which can then be nurtured for future leadership at VidyaGyan. The empowering effect of a good education was in the focus in the final session of the day when Anand Kumar who runs a successful centre that coaches poor, underprivileged IIT aspirants in Patna, Bihar, presented some of his success stories to the audience. Since 2002, Kumar has helped 236 poor children at the Super 30 Ramanujan School of Mathematics in Patna to enter the IITs. Kunwar Barrister Singh, 18, from Jaunpur district in Uttar Pradesh and now a firstyear student of IIT Delhi, said that Anand encouraged him to have faith in his abilities. Another student, Suresh Ram, 25, the son of a daily wage labourer, is now working with L&T as a structural design engineer. Much debate through the summit also focused on the role of teachers. Said Pratibha Jolly, principal of Delhi University's Miranda House, "The classroom is dead today because it's boring for students and teachers." She urged teachers to innovate. "A good teacher needs to be a good learner. Teachers need to discuss and forge new methods," she said. Anand Sudarshan, MD and CEO of Manipal Global Educational Services, said that

teachers needed to use technology to generate greater curiosity for themselves and for students. On the question of whether Indian universities could benefit from tie-ups with foreign universities, Delhi University Vice-Chancellor Professor Dinesh Singh said that the purpose of any tie-up should be to encourage outof-the-box thinking and innovation. Singh stressed on the importance of local tie-ups. "There is so much that even national universities can share with each other," he said. Panelists at the session which debated whether the education system equips the youth for jobs were adamant that it did not. Said Sanjeev Bikhchandani, founder of naukri.com, "We're training wrong, and training badly." Filmmaker Prakash Jha said that there was too much emphasis on viewing education simply as a means to get a job. Jha, whose film Aarakashan on the theme of reservations in education generated controversy, said, "It's a pity that India will not produce any mathematicians and scientists for a long time to come (because of emphasis only on job-oriented education). We are only manufacturing managers." Perhaps the only point of consensus amidst the debate and dissent was the all-important one on the need for change. The system as it stands has simply not delivered. Only radical change can deliver the dreams and aspirations of India's youth.
