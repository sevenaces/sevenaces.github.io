RAISING THE BAR
 Eighteen batches have completed their studies at NLSIU. Many students have pursued further studies at Oxford, Yale and other universities abroad on prestigious scholarships.  The law school has undertaken many research projects funded by UGC, Government of India, UN agencies and the World Bank, among others, which have served to strengthen research and teaching at NLSIU.  The school has exchange programmes with the National University of Singapore, Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, Canada, and Bucerius Law School, Germany.

NATIONAL LAW SCHOOL OF INDIA UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ON CAMPUS

Set up under the National Law School of India University Act, 1986, this premier law institution is spread over 23 acres in Bangalore city, in what used to be the outskirts at Nagarabhavi. The Karnataka government and Bangalore University gave the land for NLSIU, which began operations in 1988. The chief justice of India is the chancellor of this university, and from 1991, it has been a fully residential institution. It has a huge resource library sponsored by Infosys Foundation chairperson Sudha Murty, N.R. Narayana Murthy's wife, and is named after her father Melagiri Narayana Rao.

hould cricketers involved in match-fixing be criminally prosecuted? Rishi Shroff, 22, thinks so. The Bangalore boy, troubled by cricketers being let off with mere bans and fines, has written a detailed research paper listing the sections of the Indian Penal Code under which they can be criminally charged. And since several are employees of public sector units and banks, he argues that they can even

be tried as public officials under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1986. This is just one of the 60 research papers Shroff will have to write, and each of them should be worthy of publication, before he can get a five-year integrated BA, LLM degree from the National Law School of India University (NLSIU) in Bangalore. No wonder this residential school has topped the best law colleges list in the INDIA TODAY-Nielsen annual survey, for a record 11th time. Each of the 400 students on the

campus has to go through an exam every one-and-a-half months. The course work accounts for 60 marks and a research project paper with viva to defend it accounts for 35 marks; five marks go towards attendance. The emphasis is on project work, with four research papers per subject. "The subjects are fairly flexible; the course lets you do what you want. I had no idea what legal education was when I joined, but I find I really like law. But if you want to do other things, we have Strawberry

Fields, an annual rock fest; Admit One, an annual theatre festival; and a model United Nations competition," says final year student Krishna Prasad, 23, from Kerala. He is preparing to go to Oxford for further studies and wants to do commercial law when he returns to India. He has already published eight of his research papers, including one in Oxford's Statute Law Review on the application of a House of Lords decision to the Indian parliamentary and judicial system. Final year student Vrinda Bhan-

dari, 23, from Delhi, is also on her way to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship. "The student mentoring system, the interactions with others, that is what is different here. I don't think other colleges have student project guides, or the various centres of research that are available for us here. I worked with the centre on campus on social exclusion and inclusive policy, where they study caste, equity, SC/ST problems, which are not things you would do otherwise. In terms of just sensitising lives it is important as we hardly have any idea beyond our immediate circle," she says. The result is, though she is thinking of working in academics or litigation, when she returns to Delhi, her focus will be access to justice, how courts work, as well as problems of delay. "I don't want to work in a firm, whatever I do will be related to human rights. My interest is definitely some kind of rights issue," she adds. Most NLSIU alumni are corporate lawyers, with 100 per cent placements every year. The minimum salary a student earns through campus recruitment is Rs 1 lakh per month, while several leading UKbased law firms, the so-called `Magic Circle' firms, have hired this year, offering salaries up to Rs 2.2 lakh per month. But several alumni are scattered among NGOS, some have stepped

into the IAS and many do pro bono (free) work to assist the socially and economically backward. Anisha Gopi, 26, who graduated in 2008, worked for a corporate law firm for a couple of years, but that wasn't her calling. She moved out to do legal work with an NGO for battered women, Majlis, in Mumbai, before returning to work at her alma mater in the legal aid clinic. "It is a great platform. NLSIU gave students a lot of opportunity to do things, be it extracurricular or organisational activity. We were exposed to a lot of things as we have the best minds coming to the law school," she says. Another student who graduated in 2008, Cyrus Darlong Diengdoh, 27, is an IAS probationer assigned to the Assam-Meghalaya cadre. "We had political science, history, economics as part of our curriculum,

we did case studies to analyse all issues of society, which helped us understand the problem and how to approach it in law. Workshops and conferences opened up avenues in terms of thinking of law as a tool for social change, it is truly empowering," he says. One of the oldest research centres on campus, the Centre for Child and Law, headed by Neethu Sharma, 36, has an extension centre at Bidadi, where students work with village children, their teachers and bring dropouts back into the mainstream. "NLSIU students volunteer, come and do research work with us. We are currently working on the mid-day meal scheme, comparing it to the food served in the juvenile justice homes where there are no standards. We will give our findings and recommendations to

the Karnataka government for implementation," she says. Other ongoing research centres cover environmental issues, human rights, law and ethics in medicine, intellectual property rights (IPR) and management of common resources. With this kind of commitment to social uplift, ViceChancellor R. Venkata Rao is justly proud of the project work and the extra-curricular activities on his campus that make his students stand out. "We don't cover the syllabus, we uncover it," he says. Rao himself specialises in human rights law. "I think we do our best work in the afternoons. Regular classes end at 1.30 p.m. and in the afternoon, we have seminars and workshops. We invite people from public life, judges, IAS officers and people from different and diverse areas in life for our students to interact with. There are over 60 seminars, we add courses in emerging areas like IPR, patents, copyright law, surrogacy, biodiversity and so on. Our aim is intellectually stimulant, professionally competent and socially relevant education," he adds.

and scholars drop by at NLSIU to confer with the students. Naturally, the fees are steep for courses at this university, costing over a lakh a year at the undergraduate level, but scholarships and financial aid are in plentiful for those who need it. "We have eight to 10 students every year, which is 10 per cent of our intake, who get financial aid. This year, one of our teams identified and mentored a person (identity withheld to protect privacy) from a poor background to take the entrance exam and get placed. We are paying for the person's complete education, and we plan to move out to the villages to identify more such deserving candidates,'' Rao adds. The challenge to scale now is not to scale the peak, but to remain at the

 Several leading UK-based law firms, the so-called `Magic Circle' firms, have hired this year offering salaries up to Rs 2.2 lakh per month.  The minimum salary a student at NLSIU earns through campus recruitment is Rs 1 lakh per month.  Campus placements at NLSIU are 100 per cent every year.

top. "Our students are encouraged to come up with out-of-the-box ideas, focus on innovation, co-curricular and extracurricular activities. We want everyone here to enjoy their jobs. As eldest son of the family of 14 national law schools, our mandate is now to leapfrog to the next generation of legal reforms, towards a more responsive legal education, where social responsibility will be the focus," says the vice-chancellor. NLSIU is closely followed by Delhi University's (DU) faculty of law, that has had a nine-decade-long record of excellence. DU, that was started in 1924, is known for excellent research facilities, visiting fellows from across the world and topnotch academia. It stands at number two ranking this year, up from number four in 2011. The third spot goes to last year's topper, the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research (NALSAR), Hyderabad, an institution the NLSIU faculty consider its "child". In terms of quality and the facilities available, there is little to choose between the two. But there is healthy competition, that breeds quality education.
