Mayawati's ability to attract massive crowds remains unparalleled. She is playing the caste card like only she can.

lections are upon us. The main contenders in this winner-takes-all derby are: the Shiromani Akali Dal (PPP1, Papa Putar Party), the Congress (PPP2, Patiala Peg Party) and the dark horse People's Party of Punjab (PPP3). Will BJP (PPP4, Party Poopers' Party) be left chasing the pack? The jockeys are wearing their silks. PPP1 Blue, PPP2 White, PPP3 Yellow and PPP4 Saffron. There are no favourites in this race. Some have SCAMpered there with transport, sand, cable TV, and seven star resorts. Others have been brought under the scanner by Team Anna for their misdeeds. Others have a cloud (badal) of suspicion hanging over them. Now voters are in the stands-- waiting, isn't it? They are waiting for starters' orders. Candidates are tense, sensing the start is imminent. A group of fine fillies and stallions are leaping out of the

hen Mayawati came to power in 2007, she built the 76-acre Ramabai Rally Sthal in Lucknow to accommodate a crowd of five lakh. She has held six rallies here for her party cadre, three of them in the last two months. She is the only leader to have done so in such a sprawling space. Each of her three recent rallies has focused on a particular community. On November 13, she held a Brahmin Sammelan where Satish Chandra Misra, the BSP's Brahmin face, described Mayawati as "kanoon ki devi". A fortnight later, she addressed a rally for the party's Scheduled Castes and backward class workers. BSP state President Swami Prasad Maurya shared the dais with her. On December 18, it was the turn of the Muslim votebank, for whom she paraded BSP leader Naseemuddin Siddiqui. Mayawati always arrives on time. And even though a mere 12 km separates her bungalow at 5, Kalidas Marg and the rally ground, she prefers flying in by helicopter. She then arrives at the venue in an Ambassador, usually accompanied by a fleet of 10 cars. At the venue, she is at her combative best, hitting out at both Samajwadi Party and the Congress. Taunting Rahul Gandhi's attacks on her, she says, "The elephant has started haunting Congress leaders even in their dreams." The applause is deafening. by Ashish Misra

TO BE OR NOT TO BE
Talk about being fickle. The Samajwadi Party (SP) has changed its candidate for the Lambhua Assembly seat in Sultanpur district seven times in the last few months. Santosh Pandey, SP's original choice in July, is again frontrunner for the ticket. But for how long?

gates...and they're off! All are jockeying for vantage positions. Candidates beg, persuade, and say nice things, hoping it will bring votes. The stakes are high, the ambition higher, to rule the state for five years. It does not look like a one-horse race. The SAD/BJP and Congress are neck-and-neck. The People's Party of Punjab is way behind, jockeying for a breakthrough. Expect the race to hot up as they are all rumoured to be announcing publicity blitzes and slander campaigns in the coming weeks. Unfortunately, the SAD/BJP alliance is handicapped by anti-incumbency and PPP3 by a chip on its regal shoulder. The winner here could be determined by just a few votes so make yours count. The contenders will soon be coming to the finish line. Will it be a photo finish?

Harsimrat Kaur sure knows how to catch 'em young. The MP from Bathinda and wife of Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal is in trouble with the Election Commission (EC). On December 7, she asked children at a government school in Datewas village in Mansa district to ask their parents to vote for the Shiromani Akali Dal. EC officials will look up YouTube, where a video clip of the incident has been uploaded, for `evidence' .

Hours before the poll dates were announced and the model code of conduct came into force, SAD announced a lastminute sop. Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal withdrew octroi levied on diesel and petrol. This reduced diesel price by 70 paise and petrol by 80 paise. But here's the slip. The withdrawal was announced not through a proper notification but merely through an office memo. This raised questions about the validity of the decision. The EC has put the decision on hold.

He may be bed-ridden but Atal Bihari Vajpayee still remains the BJP'S best bet in the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. Local candidates have his picture splashed across their posters. There is a reason for this. Ask the youth in the state to name their icon and the answer is Vajpayee. "He is the only leader we know," a college student from Ambedkarnagar told INDIA TODAY recently. No surprise then that his 88th birthday was celebrated by the BJP recently as Good Governance Day all over India. by Priya Sahgal

RAHUL GANDHI , IN LAKHIMPUR ON DECEMBER 27

t's a family soap opera in Lambi constituency with Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, 84, being challenged by his younger brother Gurdas, 82. The two fell out when Gurdas's son Manpreet Badal, then finance minister, quit the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in October 2010. Soon after, Manpreet floated the People's Party of Punjab. Before they fell out, Gurdas (known as Dasji) managed the Chief Minister's (Pashji) constituency for him. A sub-plot to this potboiler is the Congress candidate Mahesh Inder Singh, who is a cousin of the Badal brothers. Lambi's outcome could shape political destinies of both the GenNext Badals--Manpreet and Sukhbir. Except 1992 when the party boycotted the polls, Lambi has always been represented by the SAD. The Chief Minister has won thrice from here. But SAD's victory margin here has been shrinking. As the Congress nominee in February 2007, Mahesh Inder Singh lost against his older cousin by a mere 9,000 votes. Desperate to retain the image of a just family patriarch, Parkash Singh Badal tells villagers that he had given his nephew everything he wanted but "the boy betrayed me". Gurdas insists it was his brother who reneged on his promise to make Manpreet his successor. The battle for Lambi has just begun. by Asit Jolly
