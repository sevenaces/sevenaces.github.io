Fantasy Queen
Shikha Swaroop is back to dreamy palace walks and over-the-top dressing. The former Miss India, best known for playing the title role in the TV series Chandrakanta in 1996, will play Kaikayee in the latest version of Ramayan, that will go on air from August 12 on Zee TV. "This role is as spiritual as and more powerful than Sita." How wonderful.

I AM EVERY WOMAN

BAG

Bengali model and actor Bidita Bag has made the transition to Hindi films with Prateek Chakravorty's From Sydney With Love. In spite of a long line-up of TV commercials, Bengali film Icche, and As The River Flows with filmmaker Bidyut Kotoky, she would rather talk about how she resembles Kangna Ranaut and sounds like Deepika Padukone. "I've been offered movies by filmmakers who say that I fit the bill for a Kangna-type-of-role," she says. Confused, aren't we?

Back to Reality
Nausheen Sardar Ali, 31, and Anuj Saxena, 45, separated and reunited time and again as television's tumultuous couple Kkusum and Abhay, in Kkusum. They will come together again, as hosts of Crimes of Passion, a TV series that will go on air from August 6 on Big TV and highlight the crimes against women in India. Made for each other.
