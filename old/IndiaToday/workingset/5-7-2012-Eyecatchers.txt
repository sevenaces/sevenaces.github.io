JUST HER LUCK
She shot four films in the last six years, but not one of them was released. Former Miss India Earth (2005) Niharika Singh, 29, has finally made her debut with a bang. The film titled Miss Lovely is a sleazy-horror film and will be screened at the Cannes Film Festival 2012. She plays the role of Pinky, a fantasy character. Singh came to Mumbai in 2003 after dropping out of Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi. "I want to be part of special stories on screen," says the no-longer newbie, who has almost completed a memoir of her experiences as a struggling actor. It should be worth a read.
