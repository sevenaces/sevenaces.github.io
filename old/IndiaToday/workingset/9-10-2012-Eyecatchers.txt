Same Face, New Name
Pakistani actor Mona Lizza, 26, has returned as Sara Loren to play the second female lead in Vishesh Bhatt's Murder 3. The only reason we remember her is because she was in another Bhatt film, Pooja Bhatt's Kajraare opposite Himesh Reshammiya. She co-stars with Aditi Rao Hydari and Randeep Hooda with Mukesh Bhatt's son Vishesh debuting as director. Will she make an impact this time? In the interest of peace with Pakistan, we hope so.

Rite Role
The BCCI may be upset about a Sahara Q Shop TV commercial featuring five Indian cricketers, but model Arpita Chatterjee is delighted. That's because the 38-year-old shares the frame with Sachin Tendulkar as he performs last rites around a breakfast table. A popular face in advertisements for Dettol, Sunfeast Yippee and Odomos, Chatterjee is a trained classical dancer and has also starred in several Bengali movies. She is married to Bengali actor Prosenjit.
