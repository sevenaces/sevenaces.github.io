I have never missed not having a husband. I don't need a man to travel, party or open a bank account. This is the 21st century and I don't think a woman is a `babe in the woods' anymore.

I don't think I'd want a husband to deal with my finances, I'd rather seek help from a professional. Being single gives me the freedom to do what I want on my terms.

I need a man I can bank on and trust with my life. Ideally, I want my man to fill the void that is created when I cannot share my thoughts and crises. I am a creative person who is extremely sensitive. I want my man to complement that side of me.

I earn enough to make a living. In any case, I wouldn't depend on my partner.That would be a blow to my self-esteem.

Every woman should have a career. I am very happy with the direction in which my career is going.

THE JOYS OFBEING SINGLE

eet the single woman of 2012. Freedom? Yes! Money in the bank? Yes! Sex? Occasionally, but it's not top priority. Men? Nice if you have them around, but again, not necessary. Mother-in-law? No way! In a sea change from even a decade ago, the single Indian woman has arrived. If she is in her 20s, she is single by choice; if in her 30s, she is looking for a relationship, but is stable without one. Those in

their late 30s and 40s are often divorcees, happily out of `untrustworthy' relationships. Those in their 50s are content with worthy causes and established businesses. A 2011 projection of the 2001 Census figures by Syeeda Unissa of the International Institute of Population Studies, Mumbai, shows that in the 20-49 age group, single women form 11.6 per cent of the total population. That amounts to 2.42 crore single women in the working age group in the country. The largest chunk of single women, as per her estimates, is in the 45-49 age group, which comprises 2.9 million singletons who are unmarried, separated or divorced, which is 13 per cent of the population in that bracket. In contrast, unmarried, separated or divorced men in this age group form a mere 4.5 per cent. The single woman of today invests right and holds down a demanding job. She provides for her children, and plans her retirement. She is market-savvy and understands economics without turning a hair. "Girls in the age group of 22-25 consult us and put away Rs 10,000 per month as investment. Single women in their 30s take risks and invest in mutual funds, single mothers in their 40s invest for children and plan retirement, women in their 50s and 60s often have big corpuses and spend surpluses easily," says Srikala Bhashyam, managing partner of Bangalore-based R.S. Consultants. At a time when even women from the lower middle class are standing up to social evils and refusing to pay dowry, the more empowered urban singleton is a woman on the move. The new Bollywood heroine like the strong Vidya Balan of Kahaani, the self-confident Kareena Kapoor in Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu, and perhaps, even Priyanka Chopra's search for the ideal man through seven husbands in 7 Khoon Maaf, seem to actually mirror the evolving Indian woman. In the real world, there is postgraduate student and part-time radio jockey Ananya Adhikary, 22, living happily all by herself in a flat in Kolkata, playing her sarod,

cooking her own meals and painting her rooms in the colours she wants. Says Adhikary, "I do have a lot of male friends. But no man makes me feel more secure than I myself can. Men can be good company but not beyond that. I am not looking at sex now. The day I do, I hope someone fulfils my needs.'' Attitude, and loads of it. There is Vidya Gajapati Raj Singh, 58, from the erstwhile royal family of Vijayanagaram, whose husband left her for another woman. "I have learnt age doesn't matter as long as you have the ability and will to do whatever it takes to live life," she says. "The only man in my life right now is my son,'' adds the wedding planner from Chennai. "Let's face it, men are boring. They have not kept pace with women,'' contends Delhi-based social scientist Shiv Visvanathan, who maintains that the trend of single women in India will continue to grow for another 20 years. "Education, professionalism and mobility have changed Indian women. Society has changed and the level of stigma has gone down, parents accept single daughters. Single mothers are more vulnerable, but they also have coalitions of support." Social activist Kamla Bhasin of Jagori, a resource centre espousing feminist causes in Delhi, agrees that this is certainly true of the urban singleton,

Financial independence is very important to me. It gives me a sense of satisfaction to not have to depend on anyone other than myself.

BANKABLE BARGAIN
Banks offer specific loans and banking services for working women. Schemes like Mahila Gold, Vanita Vahan and Nari Shakti offer women loans to buy gold, vehicles and to start enterprises. Interest rates on these loans are between 1 and 2 per cent lower for women.

and will soon be the case with the more oppressed rural woman. "My mother could not have walked out of a marriage. But if my daughter does not find a man who respects her dignity, I, as a mother, would support her if she decides to walk out,'' she maintains. In line with higher social acceptance, single women find encouragement in practical terms as well in modern India. Insurance firms have come up with specific schemes for the

Work to learn, not just to earn. Every woman should be financially independent, even if she feels she doesn't need it.

flats in its projects is to single women. "It's a market that is growing steadily,'' says CEO Jackbastian Nazareth. Single women are now taking houses on rent and living on their own without any hassle, though not everywhere. Says fashion designer Anindita Basak, 37, from Kolkata, a divorcee, "Contrary to popular perception, it was never a problem for me to get accommodation on rent just because I am single.'' In more conservative Hyderabad, V. Balaji, a real estate consultant, says the situation is changing in the city's upcoming business district in Madhapur-Gachibowli area: "Many builders are setting up studio apartments targeting single women. There are many old people who seek single women as tenants. Almost 40 per cent of my clients are single women." Singledom reason to sulk? No longer. Single women can be seen at bars partying the night away. "We had started Ladies Night about seven years ago, based on the American experience. It has become so popular that all bars and pubs have them now. About 40 per cent of my clientele is women,'' says Khanindra `Kay', 34, owner of Beach nightclub in Bangalore. Stereotypes are falling by the wayside. "Upper middle class women like me usually have fathers or boyfriends

''

Insurance companies also have specific schemes for single women with lower premiums that could be up to Rs 1,000 lesser. The drawback is that these schemes do not offer all the facilities regular insurance schemes do.

TAILOR-MADE TRAVEL
The single working woman powers the cosmetics, domestic appliances and fitness industries. Travel agents have also devised specific schemes. For instance, Cox & Kings, Hyderabad, provides customised packages for single women to destinations such as Singapore, Thailand, Maldives, Mauritius and Malaysia. The travel market for single women has grown 600 per cent in the last seven years, with expenditure on a holiday up to Rs 5 lakh.

SWEET SUITES
The realty market sees the single woman as a booming new segment. Trends in Bangalore show that nearly 15 per cent of units built are being sold to them; in Hyderabad, single-women complexes are being built, in line with the western trend. Flats in Bangalore for single women cost in the range of Rs 40 lakh to nearly Rs 1 crore.

INTERVIEW DEEPIKA PADUKONE

"I RUN MYOWN LIFE"
At 25, she owns two houses and three cars, including a BMW 5-series. She hosts her own parties, plans her investments and lives life as she pleases. Deepika Padukone, the epitome of the young upwardly mobile Indian woman she has played in her films, talks to Assistant Editor SOWMYA AJI. Q. Has the single woman finally arrived? A. I definitely think so. Girls are seen not in terms of their relationship status but as individuals, confident in their own skin. They have a mind of their own, can earn their money and want to be considered equal to men. Q. Is your life more fun than your mother's? A. I run my own life, live on my own, make my own money. My parents support me in everything I do. But I am responsible for my home and the life that I have chosen for myself. At my age, my mother was married and she had me. I don't know if my life is more fun. I was not part of her generation to compare. Q. Who decides your finances? A. I do. My father takes care of my finances but we decide together on investments. Q. What's your take on sex and relationships? A. My character Meera Pandit in Love Aaj Kal is exactly the way I am in real life. Practical, modern and yet, in love, comfortable with the traditional. I look up to my parents as an example of what a relationship should be. I want something that endures. Q. Do you have any insecurities? A. What would I be insecure about? For now, I'm single and happy. I am not looking at getting married. I am financially stable, have a roof above my head and wise investments. Q. Is this kind of single life easier to live now? A. Trends are changing. People are okay with divorce, okay with having a love child, even okay with splitting up after children. These things were not acceptable a couple of years ago. If people are happy, I don't think anybody should judge. Q. Where do you see the position of the Indian woman 10 years from now? A. A lot more liberated than we are. I think women will be more expressive. But I hope the one thing an Indian woman will never change is her culture and values.

running typically `manly' errands for them like getting the car stereo fixed or getting tyres changed. I take care of all of that myself. Never mind the strange looks I get from men,'' says Delhiite Kirin Vas, 23, who runs an online jewellery design site, Funkanatomy. The single mother is taking life head-on. "There was no meaning in holding on to a bad relationship. My parents had given me education and that helped me take a decision and end the relationship. That, in fact, helped me provide a better life for my children. It is liberating to take control of one's life," says divorcee R. Rajeswari Iyer, 48, a media consultant from Hyderabad. And it isn't just about work and children for singletons. They're having a blast going on holidays with other women or on their own. The travel industry, along with the cosmetics and physical fitness sectors, has marked the single woman out as a distinct market opportunity. Obviously, today's single woman doesn't fit the bahu-beti mould of Indian soaps. "I dread the oppression that marriage brings, with relatives and in-laws expecting me to follow their wishes. For me, living-in is the best option,'' says Bangalore schoolteacher and theatre person Deepthy Chandrashekar, 33. Delhi fashion designer Mridu Sahai, 24, sums up the attitude of this segment: "Being single brings a sense of freedom with it because you're not answerable to anyone. Personally, I feel that at this stage in my life, a relationship will only complicate things for me since I'd rather focus on building my career." Freedom and being on top of things is all fine, but being single has its flip side. Author Smita Jain, 39, has conjured characters such as Kkrishnaa, a 20-something Mumbai-based singleton billed as India's answer to Bridget Jones, and Kasthuri Kumar aka Katie, another Mumbai singleton who lives life on her own terms. But she feels reality is different from fiction: "Till 30, being single is fun. But with everyone else getting married and going the family way, the comfort zone shrinks."
