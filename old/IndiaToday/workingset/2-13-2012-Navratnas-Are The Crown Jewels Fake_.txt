India once called its great public sector corporations the nation's crown jewels. Government mismanagement has destroyed their lustre. Should taxpayers keep them afloat?
By Sandeep Bamzai

ARE THE CROWN JEWELS FAKE?
after body blow to these companies. But the last seven years of UPA have seen them hurtling from one crisis to another. According to Panchayati Raj and Tribal Affairs Minister and former chairman of the high-powered committee on public undertakings Kishore Chandra Deo, the ill-fated shotgun wedding scripted by former civil aviation minister Praful Patel in 2007 between Indian Airlines and Air India is responsible for the state carrier lying on its death bed. Similarly, two successive DMK ministers, Dayanidhi Maran and A. Raja, oversaw the demise of the telecom twins--Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL). Not only did they choose not to effect a merger of BSNL and MTNL, they ignored the harsh reality of shoring up the business by not building network capacities. Constant re-tendering and illtimed 3G and broadband wireless bandwidth acquisitions have resulted in a massive erosion of their net worth.

any of the navratnas that form the mainframe of the public sector in India stand debilitated. The Government has destroyed its own assets with merciless indifference, allowing policy drift to undermine what were once considered its crown jewels. Crown jewels that have since proved to be fake. Poor ideas and even poorer execution have added to the woes of public sector undertakings (PSU). As long as they functioned as oligopolies or monopolies, they were the undisputed kings. But once the winds of competition blew in, they began to suffer. Wealth creators have turned wealth destroyers. Successive governments and successive ministers have delivered blow

RUN INTO THE GROUND
The woes of the oil marketing companies (OMC) are a classic case of ad hocism. The blame rests squarely with the UPA Government. The H.D. Deve Gowda Cabinet in 1997 decided to de-regulate petroleum prices. It was decided to install the new regime on April 1, 2002 when the BJP-led NDA Government decided to adjust petroleum prices in tandem with global prices every fortnight. This system worked well and carried on till September-October 2003 when Assembly elections were called. The deregulation experiment was jettisoned till June 2010. Between UPA oil ministers Mani Shankar Aiyar, Murli Deora and S. Jaipal Reddy, healthy OMCs

BSNL and MTNL are seeing a rapid erosion in their top line, earnings and brand equity as they struggle to stay afloat in an increasingly competitive environment. R. Chandrasekhar, secretary, Department of Telecommunications (DoT), tells INDIA TODAY, "DoT needs to take proactive and pre-emptive measures to salvage these two companies. Remember, there is a public interest which is being served by public sector companies. If they are left unattended and a business-asusual approach is applied, then they could run into severe problems. Drastic measures are the need of the hour and IOC's borrowings have ballooned to Rs 73,000 cr. By not we are alive to this." Cash-strapped deregulating diesel, OMCs continue to bleed from skewed policies. and loss-making BSNL

have been run into the ground. Petroleum product price deregulation, when it did come about in June 2010, was incomplete, burdening petrol car users while diesel guzzlers continue exploiting the price differential between the fuels which is in excess of Rs 26. India's largest public sector company, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), with a JulySeptember 2011 gross turnover of Rs 93,868 crore, is in the throes of a crisis. Its net loss for the second quarter of 2011-12 stands at Rs 7,486 crore. Hindustan Petroleum has reported a net loss of Rs 3,364 crore while its oil marketing twin Bharat Petroleum has posted a loss of Rs 3,229 crore for the

same period. IOC Finance Director P.K. Goyal tells INDIA TODAY, "As of today, there are no problems in raising money to import crude, but if the under-recoveries continue and no compensation package is forthcoming from the Government, then problems will arise. We are losing Rs 28 per litre on kerosene, Rs 326 per LPG cylinder and Rs 12 per litre of diesel, some of this subsidy is unsustainable over the long term." IOC's borrowings have ballooned to Rs 73,000 crore. By not deregulating diesel, OMCs continue to bear the brunt of skewed policies which continue to subsidise petroleum products without compensating them with cash payouts. The

oil companies are caught between a rock and a hard place.

has offered to surrender its Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) spectrum in 17 circles, seeking a refund of Rs 8,313.80 crore. It has reportedly posted a net loss of over Rs 6,000 crore for 2010-11, mainly due to high staff costs and payments made for acquiring 3G and BWA spectrum. BSNL suffered a net loss of Rs 1,823 crore during 2009-10. A far cry from the time when the company reported a net profit of over Rs 10,000 crore in 2005-06. What's worse is that it wants a handout from the Government to tide over its financial crisis. The question, then, that begs an answer is whether good money should be spent on bad money. Should taxpayers continue to cough up for bad decision-making by the Government? Bajaj Auto Chairman Rahul Bajaj, a votary of Government exiting business, tells INDIA TODAY, "Those public sector companies which are really sick and hence not saleable should be made saleable by writing off debts and if this doesn't attract buyers, the Government should consider closing such units after giving all the employees their legal dues and a reasonable Voluntary Retirement Scheme (see box)." Mahesh Vyas, managing director at the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, echoes the privatisation line. "There is an urgent need for greater commitment to full and complete privatisation of PSUs. The Government should get out of business completely and stick to governance. This is the only way out." According to top stockbroker Ramesh Damani, BSNL and MTNL are basket cases. He says, "Obviously, they have been bypassed by the telecom revolution which has moved in so aggressively. Both have to be sold off; there is no business case anymore for the Government to stay in the telecom sector. In a competitive set-up, they have seen an erosion in their market share. MTNL's market cap is less than its payroll cost." BSNL is already preparing a voluntary retirement scheme for employees as part of efforts to revive the loss-making company. It has set an internal target of 99,700 employees--comprising Group A (1,483), Group B (6,262), Group C (76,655) and Group D (15,214) staffers. The VRS has been under discussion since

"Privatise non-strategic PSUs"
n India, specially keeping in mind our socialist history, we should not privatise public utilities like electricity boards and water supply systems even though they have been privatised in countries like the UK. Those companies which are considered strategic, such as ONGC and the oil marketing companies, may for the time being be retained and a small percentage of their equity may be disinvested in the capital market. All other PSUs which have no justification for continuing to exist should be privatised by offering majority control to a strategic partner. Since this route is unacceptable to most political parties, disinvestment should be taken up to 49 per cent. Let the Government retain 51 per cent. Why leave the divestment at 10 per cent or thereabouts? Disinvestment and, ultimately, privatisation will bring in inflation management and accountability. In the process, the Government will receive funds which it badly needs. The price fetched will depend on the PSU concerned and the condition of the stock market. However, whatever the price, disinvestment of PSUs should be done only through the stock market route and not to strategic partners. It shouldn't be seen as selling family heirlooms. Whatever price the Government receives will offset the need to infuse taxpayers' money.

IOC HAS BEEN LOSING MONEY STEADILY

India's biggest lender SBI failed to adopt best practices in the case of Kingfisher Airlines.
2009 when a panel headed by Sam Pitroda, adviser to the Prime Minister on public information infrastructure and innovations, recommended that BSNL take the VRS route to prune its nearly 2.77 lakh-strong workforce by a third. Damani says that to resolve the complex problems of the telecom twins, "the Government needs to be proactive in its approach, which is extremely difficult for it is afflicted by political paralysis". trum payments and the operational losses incurred in 2010, it ended fiscal 2011 with a net debt of nearly Rs 11,000 crore. The company's high level of indebtedness is further weakening its financial performance. Staff costs, excluding expenses for retirement benefits, fell marginally to Rs 423 crore, while the actual payout for retirement benefits climbed 22 per cent to Rs 124 crore. Besides, provisions for retirement benefits rose to Rs 254 crore. The firm has approached the Government to approve a VRS for about one-third of its workforce to deal with high costs. The long-pending merger of BSNL and MTNL has been hanging fire for years now, moving from one table to another as pen-pushers refuse to sign off on the big-ticket decision. "There is a clear business case for a merger. There is no ambiguity about this and, in fact, it is now increasingly being driven by compulsions; this is the only way to go. At the same time, we have to look at a listing exercise for BSNL and we are looking at completing it over the next 12 months," says Chandrasekhar. Some of the biggest Governmentowned companies are suffering due to

ver the past year, the price of MTNL's stock has more than halved to Rs 26. Its second quarter results for the period ending September are in a shambles as the net loss of Rs 864 crore is more than the company's turnover of Rs 861 crore. As with BSNL, the company's financial condition worsened after the 3G and BWA auctions, since it had to match the top bids made by private sector firms. As a result, it had to shell out Rs 6,564 crore for the 3G spectrum and another Rs 4,534 crore for the BWA spectrum in the Delhi and Mumbai circles. At the start of the previous financial year, the company had a net cash position of around Rs 6,300 crore. After the spec-

the apathy and drift on the part of policymakers. And several of them are listed entities, which means that they have institutional and retail shareholders who expect performance from them. There are times when the Government takes recourse to the plea that public causes have to be funded by public money. As Chandrasekhar says, "We don't propose to give BSNL a dole, we expect them to compete, but you need to understand that sometimes public interest is being served by a PSU. Rural telephony penetration is something that only BSNL does and it needs to be subsidised for that."

MOUNTAIN OFBAD ASSETS
In early November, banking behemoth State Bank of India (SBI) posted a 12.4 per cent rise in earnings, halting a twoquarter decline, but worsening asset quality shook investors and sent its shares into a tailspin by as much as seven per cent after international rating agency Moody's Investor Service issued a warning about SBI's rising bad loans or non-performing assets and downgraded its rating to a D+. SBI has given out loans to sectors where returns are minimal. That is why the quality of its capital has taken a hit. This happened because the bank followed poor credit

appraisal processes and inadequate monitoring of the asset quality across its loan portfolio, resulting in a surge of bad assets which have gone up from 1.7 per cent a year ago to 2.04 per cent. Despite being India's biggest lender, SBI appears to have failed to adopt international best practices. Take the case of Kingfisher Airlines where SBI finds itself caught in a conflict of interest situation. By converting debt into equity, it became a part owner of the airline with 5.6 per cent equity. So its primary interest would be to protect the owner's interest. In parallel, by extending loans, it is a lender to the same airline. Hence, it fails to protect its interests, both as a shareholder as well as a lender. The SBI management is answerable to its shareholders on what prompted it to take this decision. If it was under pressure from the Government, it mirrors the extent to which political interference can overrule decisions based on prudential norms. By formally accepting on January 5 that "Kingfisher is a non-performing asset for SBI and they are in default", SBI Chairman Pratip Chaudhuri accepted that its exposure to the airline amounting to Rs 1,457.78 crore may be bad. Chaudhuri added that the airline has 90 days to repay its loans. The ques-

tion is what was the bank doing all this while? Says brokerage house K.R. Choksey, "The downgrade has come as a shock to us and the market." No sooner did this happen that the bank approached the Government for recapitalisation, adding pressure on its already stretched finances. In many ways, the Kingfisher loan is symptomatic of how public sector banks are run. The bank has now received a communiqué from the Government saying it will infuse Rs 6,000 crore over the next few months. Good money again being thrown after bad. It's the same story across PSUs. The Government needs to pay for their cumulative sins. Coal India is beset with corruption and scandals. Says Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal, "Yes, there is rampant corruption in Coal India. But I have cracked down on it. I have personally asked CBI to intervene and go after the corrupt individuals within Coal India. I am constantly talking to chief ministers and asking them to go after the corrupt in their areas of influence. We have to change the way natural resources are being misused to make money." The recent seizure of Rs 70 crore in cash from the house of a coal contractor in Jharia, Dhanbad, drives home the point. Contractor Lal Babu Singh, with Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, was caught with this cash by the Income Tax Department. Jaiswal has attempted to clean up the mess but Lal Babu is symptomatic of the malaise that grips the sector. Coal India operates 471 mines and enjoys a near monopoly but on the flip side, it faces hurdles such as the proposal to share 26 per cent profits with tribals, inability to obtain environmental clearances, controversy over `go' and `no-go' areas, Naxal attacks and higher costs without an increase in prices. While the poor health of many PSUs is reflective of the paralysis that grips governance, the long-term fallout of the Government playing nursemaid to bail out large corporations which have failed to deal with new economic realities is not lost on taxpayers.
