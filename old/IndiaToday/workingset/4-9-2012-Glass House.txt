wo leaders criticised for being stiff in public finally answered their critics with a hug. Barack Obama is accused of being aloof and distant. Manmohan Singh is said to behave like a puppet. So no surprise that they sought solace in a warm embrace at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul on March 26. Sweet.

SINGH (LEFT) AND OBAMA IN SEOUL AKHILESH (CENTRE) ENTERING HIS 5, KALIDAS MARG HOME

HOME AGAIN
n March 25, the road to the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister's home at 5, Kalidas Marg, Lucknow, was opened to the general public for the first time in five years. When Mayawati became chief minister in 2007 she barricaded the entire road. But the first thing Akhilesh Yadav did upon moving in was to throw it open to samajwad. Akhilesh had a housewarming party for workers. On the made-for-Navratra menu was puri aloo, chaat and chhole kulchas. Akhilesh then accompanied Mulayam and uncle Shivpal Yadav on a tour of the house. Did they see Mayawati's famed panel of closed-circuit televisions? Or has she taken it with her?

OMAR THE SENIOR
trifle dismayed initially after losing his place as India's youngest serving chief minister to Akhilesh Yadav, 38, Omar Abdullah, 42, has finally acknowledged his seniority in years. "I'm getting old. I now need to start using glasses to read," he tweeted on March 22, with an accompanying picture showing off his newly acquired eyewear.

NEW POWER CENTRE
awed Usmani is now the man to call in Uttar Pradesh. An IAS officer of the 1978 batch, Akhilesh Yadav has chosen Usmani as chief secretary. Usmani has worked with Akhilesh's father before, first as secretary when Mulayam was chief minister in 1993-95 and then as principal secretary to the chief minister in 2004. This will be quite a change from his recent sabbatical. Usmani was visiting scholar at the Centre for Advanced Study of India at University of Pennsylvania and visiting fellow at Boston University since November 2010. He also did two stints at the PMO, between 1996 and 2001 and 2004 to 2007. Perfect, if what they say is true: That Mulayam has designs on the Centre.

aharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar refused to answer frantic calls from his boss Prithviraj Chavan on March 21, when presidents of 27 zilla parishads were being elected. Ajit fielded NCP candidates for all 27 posts with support from Shiv Sena and BJP. This was despite uncle Sharad Pawar's announcement that NCP would not go saffron. Result: NCP won 13 posts while Congress only seven. The rest went to Shiv Sena and BJP.

NOT-SO-JOLLY

SMART MOVE
mong the many sharp moves IIT graduate Manohar Parrikar has made since becoming Chief Minister of Goa is this: He has reduced the high entrance fee at Goa's offshore casinos from Rs 2,000 to Rs 500. Anti-people? Not really. He believes high fees leads to evasion and loss of revenue.

istribution of tickets for April 15 elections to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi has never been as acrimonious. Both the BJP and Congress battled rebellion within while finalising the names of 272 candidates. However, things became exceptionally ugly in the BJP election committee when two senior members, Vijay Jolly and Ramesh Bidhuri, got involved in a brawl on distribution of tickets for key south Delhi seats. Senior leader and Delhi BJP incharge M. Venkaiah Naidu could not prevent them from hurling abuse at each other. Finally, he threw both Jolly and Bidhuri out of the committee, allowing them back only after two days when they apologised.

A ROYAL MATCH
inister of State for External Affairs Preneet Kaur may finally meet her `royal' match in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. With the Akali leadership actively wooing estranged brother-in-law Malwinder Singh as their candidate from Patiala, her adoring sasuraal, which returned Preneet as its MP three times in succession, may no longer be `safe' for the maharani. Malwinder is thrilled at the prospect: "If the party nominates me, I'm up for it."

"For only Rs 100 crore revenue, I realise how much you will have to go through. Like mosquitoes in the night, in our country there are some departments that suck blood."

aving made a sensational disclosure about being offered a bribe, army chief General V.K. Singh was suddenly inaccessible. Turns out that he was on a visit to his ancestral village, Bapora, near Bhiwani, where retired soldiers had organised an ex-servicemen medical camp and parasailing display. Then he went on a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir, one of the seven army commands that he is visiting before he retires on May 31. That's the life.
