Akhilesh had tried to gloss over this saying his plane had been delayed. But Khan was also a no-show at SP rallies in Deoria and Kushinagar in January. Khan does not want to put his resentment on record. He explains his absence thus: "It is not possible for a leader to be present in every rally." That's his story, for now. by Ashish Misra India TV-C-Voter survey,January 25,2012 Congress 43-47 Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP 64-72 Others 4-8 News 24-C-Voter poll,January 21,2012 Congress 54-60 Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP 56-60 Others 3 UTTARAKHAND TOTAL SEATS 70 Star News-Nielsen opinion poll,January 23,2012 BJP 39 Congress 29 Bahujan Samaj Party 2 India TV-C-Voter survey,January 25,2012 BJP 20-24 Congress 34-38 Others 9-15

HEAD START

P

oliticians will do anything to woo the voter. Literally. Ramesh Rajbhar, an independent candidate from Mubarakpur Assembly seat, has taken to falling at the voter's feet. He rests his head on the voter's foot and refuses to get up unless he gets an assurance or ashirvad (blessing). Rajbhar had used this method rather successfully during the recent panchayat elections and clearly thinks he's onto a winning formula. by Sudhir Singh

All's not well within the Samajwadi Party (SP). Its high-profile Muslim face, Azam Khan, is slowly making it known that he is not happy with the goingson within the party. On January 28, when party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav hugged Syed Ahmed Bukhari, shahi imam of Jama Masjid, at a joint press conference in Lucknow, Khan was nowhere to be seen. Later, when the imam said that he was not in favour of the 4.5 per cent reservation for Muslims as it would eat into the OBC quota and create a rift between the two communities, Khan scoffed, "Maulvis and pandits should stay away from such issues."

These polls were meant to be Khan's second coming. He rejoined the party in December 2010 after being expelled in 2009. The comeback hasn't been smooth. In early January, after he had publicly welcomed muscleman D.P. Yadav into the SP, Akhilesh Yadav, Uttar Pradesh party chief, denied him entry saying "the entry of such criminals is out of the question" . Khan's relationship with the SP leadership has declined since. He has

SHIVPAL YADAV VERSUS AKHILESH YADAV
The Samajwadi Party duo had joined forces against Amar Singh but ever since Akhilesh,38,was elevated as Uttar Pradesh party president,a job uncle Shivpal,56,was eyeing, relations have soured. He is also unhappy about Akhilesh saying no to strongman D.P.Yadav's entry into the party.

DIGVIJAYA SINGH VERSUS JANARDAN DWIVEDI
While Digvijaya,64,is the Congress general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh,Dwivedi,66, handles the war room in the Capital.The two rivals play the same avuncular role to Rahul Gandhi.It's interesting that whenever one accompanies Rahul to a rally,the other skips the show.

KALRAJ MISHRA VERSUS UMA BHARATI
Mishra,70,thought he had a chance in the BJP when Rajnath Singh,60,said he was not in the race for chief ministership. Then the BJP began to promote Uma Bharati,52.Mishra called her an "outsider".Later,he did a cop out: "I was misquoted".The two rarely campaign together. by Priya Sahgal

ajiv Gandhi promoted him as a technology icon. But for Rahul Gandhi, it is Sam Pitroda's caste that matters most. Pitroda was a surprise presence at the release of the Congress manifesto in Uttar Pradesh. Then again, not so surprising. Rahul has been wooing the Badhai vote by pointing out how the Congress has promoted Sam, a Badhai. Says Sam, "I am a Vishwakarma's son and proud of it." He knows the script. by Ashish Misra

ecurity personnel guarding the Lucknow collectorate premises were taken by surprise on January 28 when Dinesh Pratap, who is contesting as an independent candidate from Bakshi Kaa Talab Assembly constituency, approached the gate astride a buffalo flanked by scores of supporters. Pratap was prevented from entering on the buffalo despite his spirited defence: "I live amid cows and buffaloes. I do not own any vehicle". by Ashish Misra
