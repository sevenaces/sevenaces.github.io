GOGOI

SARMA

ssam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and Health and Education Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma dislike each other and it's hurting Assam. On August 5, Sarma left for Delhi despite being instructed by the Chief Minister to go to Kokrajhar and monitor relief camps. Sarma spread reports that the Congress high command called him to Delhi to coordinate northeastern MPs for the vice-presidential polls. Gogoi, however, says it's nonsense: "I asked Ahmed Patel. He denied calling Sarma." Turns out it was for lobbying against Gogoi in Delhi, which clearly matters more to Sarma than the acute crisis facing the state--where over four lakh people are suffering.

STRAIGHT TALK
JP MP Dushyant Singh just made it in time for the vice-presidential elections on August 7. Seeing him drive into Parliament, MoS Parliamentary Affairs Harish Rawat said with a smile,"Oh, I was looking for you." He was hinting at the longstanding turf war in Rajasthan between Dushyant's mother Vasundhara Raje and BJP's vice-presidential candidate Jaswant Singh, hoping that Dushyant would vote for the UPA candidate. Quick to understand this, Dushyant replied, archly, "I have just driven down all the way from Jodhpur to cast a vote for the BJP candidate not yours!"Can't blame Rawat for trying.

PATEL AT HIS PARTY'S LAUNCH IN GANDHINAGAR

TWIN PEAKS
trategies for the sideline civil war in Gujarat are emerging. While former BJP leader Keshubhai Patel will torment Narendra Modi, the Gujarat Chief Minister will ignore him. On August 6, Patel launched his new Gujarat Parivartan Party, saying its aim was to dislodge the Modi government. The same day, also in Gandhinagar, Modi pointedly ignored Patel and talked instead of Vanthabi Vikas Yatras to take his message of development to the people.

he swap at the top in the finance ministry which saw the controversial Revenue Secretary R.S. Gujral--architect of the retrospective tax on Vodafone and GAAR--switch departments with Expenditure Secretary Sumit Bose was just the first of many changes in personnel planned by P. Chidambaram. He has, since, divested Joint Secretary Rajesh Khullar of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board charge. He also sent out questionnaires to several officials of the rank of deputy secretary and above asking tough questions of their ability and desire to serve in the finance ministry. Chidambaram means business and is determined to build his own team. Officials from the previous regime are naturally looking elsewhere. One such official, Thomas Mathew, joint secretary of the crucial Capital Markets division, is on his way to Rashtrapati Bhavan.

hat they criticise, they become. After ripping into Mayawati for misusing public money on parks, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has decided to construct a park in the name of the late Samajwadi Party MP Janeshwar Mishra, also known as `Chhote Lohiya'. Construction on the Gomtinagar, Lucknow, project began on August 5, Mishra's birth anniversary. The park, spread over 367 acres, was part of what was known as Ambedkar Harit Patti (Amedkar green belt). Of course, officers of the Lucknow Development Authority immediately removed the board bearing the legend, Bhimrao Ambedkar Harit Park, after the foundation stone was laid by Akhilesh.

ranab Mukherjee's last major decision as finance minister may not see the light of day. The last file signed by the former finance minister approved the constitution of the 14th Finance Commission with former RBI governor Y.V. Reddy as chairman in the rank of Cabinet minister. Among the members in the rank of minister of state were former secretary (economic affairs) R. Gopalan, former expenditure secretary Sushma Nath and economist Parthasarathi Shome. The Prime Minister could have signed off on the appointments in his month-long stint as finance minister. But now P. Chidambaram may constitute a new commission.

ROYAL SAFARI
fter successive setbacks at the hustings, Punjab's former chief minister and state Congress President Amarinder Singh has been anxious to score a `kill' . So the Patiala royal did the next best thing--heading off for the South African game reserves where the profusion of wildlife promises far better prospects than in Punjab's unpredictable constituencies. The regal entourage-- Singh and a select group of his closest friends--flew out to Johannesburg on July 29 for 10 days of serious shikaar: Guinea fowls, francolin and, if their luck holds, maybe even a warthog or two.

WHEN IN DOUBT, CUT IT OUT
n August 4, J. Jayalalithaa banned all images from AIADMK posters except of herself and erstwhile Dravidian leaders E.V. Ramasamy Naicker, C. Annadurai and M.G. Ramachandran. Party cadres responded immediately by defacing images of all other party leaders. Order has been restored in the precariously poised world of AIADMK politicians. Amma, Dr Puratchi Thalaivi, is happy.
